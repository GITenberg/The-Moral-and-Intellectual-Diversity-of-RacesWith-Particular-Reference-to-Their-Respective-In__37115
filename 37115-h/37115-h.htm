<hr class="minor" />

<p>It has been truly observed that a good book
seldom requires, and a bad one never deserves, a
long preface. When a foreign book, however, is
obtruded on the notice of the public, it is but just
that the reasons for so doing should be explained;
and, in the present case, this is the more necessary,
as the title of the work might lead many to believe
that it was intended to re-agitate the question of
unity or plurality of the human species&mdash;a question
which the majority of readers consider satisfactorily
and forever settled by the words of Holy Writ.
Such, however, is not the purpose of either the
author or the editor. The design of this work
is, to contribute toward the knowledge of the
leading mental and moral characteristics of the
various races of men which have subsisted from
the dawn of history to the present era, and to
ascertain, if possible, the degree to which they are
susceptible of improvement. The annals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
world demonstrate beyond a doubt, that the
different branches of the human family, like the
individual members of a community, are endowed
with capacities, different not only in degree but in
kind, and that, in proportion to these endowments,
they have contributed, and still contribute to that
great march of progress of the human race, which
we term civilization. To portray the nature of
these endowments, to estimate the influence of each
race in the destinies of all, and to point out the
effects of mixture of races in the rise and fall of
great empires, has been the task to the accomplishment
of which, though too extensive for one
man, the author has devoted his abilities. The
troubles and sufferings of his native country, from
sudden political gyrations, led him to speculate
upon their causes, which he believes are to be
traced to the great variety of incongruous ethnical
elements composing the population of France. The
deductions at which he arrived in that field of
observation he subjected to the test of universal
history; and the result of his studies for many
years, facilitated by the experiences of a diplomatic
career, are now before the American public
in a translation. That a work, on so comprehensive
a subject, should be exempt from error, cannot be
expected, and is not pretended; but the aim is<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix" id="pageix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
certainly a noble one, and its pursuit cannot be
otherwise than instructive to the statesman and
historian, and no less so to the general reader.
In this country, it is peculiarly interesting and
important, for not only is our immense territory
the abode of the three best defined varieties of the
human species&mdash;the white, the negro, and the
Indian&mdash;to which the extensive immigration of
the Chinese on our Pacific coast is rapidly adding
a fourth, but the fusion of diverse nationalities is
nowhere more rapid and complete; nowhere is the
great problem of man's perfectibility being solved
on a grander scale, or in a more decisive manner.
While, then, nothing can be further removed from
our intentions, or more repugnant to our sentiments,
than to wage war on religion, or throw
ridicule on the labors of the missionary and philanthropist,
we thought it not a useless undertaking
to lay before our countrymen the opinions of a
European thinker, who, without straining or
superseding texts to answer his purposes, or departing
in any way from the pure spirit of Christianity,
has reflected upon questions which with us
are of immense moment and constant recurrence.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Before departing on one's travels to a foreign
country, it is well to cast a glance on the map,
and if we expect to meet and examine many
curiosities, a correct itinerary may not be an
inconvenient travelling companion. In laying
before the public the present work of Mr. Gobineau,
embracing a field of inquiry so boundless
and treating of subjects of such vast importance
to all, it has been thought not altogether useless
or inappropriate to give a rapid outline of the
topics presented to the consideration of the
reader&mdash;a ground-plan, as it were, of the extensive
edifice he is invited to enter, so that he may
afterwards examine it at leisure, and judge of
the symmetry of its parts. This, though fully
sensible of the inadequacy of his powers to the
due execution of the task, the present writer has
endeavored to do, making such comments on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
way, and using such additional illustrations as the
nature of the subject seemed to require.</p>

<p class="tbreak">Whether we contemplate the human family
from the point of view of the naturalist or of the
philosopher, we are struck with the marked
dissimilarity of the various groups. The obvious
physical characteristics by which we distinguish
what are termed different races, are not more
clearly defined than the psychical diversities observable
among them. "If a person," says the learned
vindicator of the unity of the human species,<a name="FNanchor-1" id="FNanchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a>
"after surveying some brilliant ceremony or court
pageant in one of the splendid cities of Europe,
were suddenly carried into a hamlet in Negro-land,
at the hour when the sable tribes recreate
themselves with dancing and music; or if he were
transported to the saline plains over which bald
and tawny Mongolians roam, differing but little in
hue from the yellow soil of their steppes, brightened
by the saffron flowers of the iris and tulip;
if he were placed near the solitary dens of the
Bushman, where the lean and hungry savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
crouches in silence, like a beast of prey, watching
with fixed eyes the birds which enter his pitfall,
or greedily devouring the insects and reptiles
which chance may bring within his grasp; if he
were carried into the midst of an Australian
forest, where the squalid companions of kangaroos
may be seen crawling in procession, in imitation of
quadrupeds, would the spectator of such phenomena
imagine the different groups which he had surveyed
to be the offspring of one family? And if
he were led to adopt that opinion, how would he
attempt to account for the striking diversities in
their aspect and manner of existence?"</p>

<p>These diversities, so graphically described by
Mr. Prichard, present a problem, the solution of
which has occupied the most ingenious minds,
especially of our times. The question of unity
or plurality of the human species has of late
excited much animated discussion; great names
and weighty authorities are enlisted on either
side, and a unanimous decision appears not likely
to be soon agreed upon. But it is not my purpose,
nor that of the author to whose writings these
pages are introductory, to enter into a contest which
to me seems rather a dispute about words than
essentials. The distinguishing physical characteristics
of what we term races of man are recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
by all parties, and whether these races are <em>distinct
species</em> or <em>permanent varieties</em><a name="FNanchor-2" id="FNanchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> only of the same,
cannot affect the subject under investigation. In
whatever manner the diversities among the
various branches of the human family may have
originated, whether they are primordial or were
produced by external causes, their permanency is
now generally admitted. "The Ethiopian cannot
change his skin." If there are, or ever have been,
external agencies that could change a white man
into a negro, or <i>vice versa</i>, it is obvious that such
causes have either ceased to operate, or operate
only in a lapse of time so incommensurable as to
be imponderable to our perceptions, for the races
which now exist can be traced up to the dawn of
history, and no well-authenticated instance of a
transformation under any circumstances is on
record. In human reasoning it is certainly legitimate
to judge of the future by the experiences of
the past, and we are, therefore, warranted to conclude
that if races have preserved their identity
for the last two thousand years, they will not lose
it in the next two thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
It is somewhat singular, however, that while
most writers have ceased to explain the physical
diversities of races by external causes, such as
climate, food, etc., yet many still persist in maintaining
the absolute equality of all in other
respects, referring such differences in character as
are undeniable, solely to circumstances, education,
mode of life, etc. These writers consider all races
as merely in different stages of development, and
pretend that the lowest savage, or at least his
offspring, may, by judicious training, and in course
of time, be rendered equal to the civilized man.
Before mentioning any facts in opposition to this
doctrine, let us examine the reasoning upon which
it is based.</p>

<p>"Man is the creature of circumstances," is an
adage extended from individuals to races, and repeated
by many without considering its bearing.
The celebrated author of <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite><a name="FNanchor-3" id="FNanchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> says,
"that the difference between the most dissimilar
characters, between a philosopher and a common
street porter, for example, arises, not so much from
nature, but from habit and education." That a
mind, which, with proper nurture, might have
graced a philosopher, should, under unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
circumstances, remain forever confined in a narrow
and humble sphere, does not, indeed, seem at
all improbable; but Dr. Smith certainly does not
mean to deny the existence of natural talents, of
innate peculiar capacities for the accomplishment
of certain purposes. This is what they do who
ascribe the mental inequality of the various
branches of the human family to external circumstances
only. "The intellectual qualities of man,"
say they, "are developed entirely by education.
The mind is, at first, a perfect blank, fitted and
ready to receive any kind of impressions. For
these, we are dependent on the political, civil, and
religious institutions under which we live, the
persons with whom we are connected, and the circumstances
in which we are placed in the different
periods of life. Wholly the creatures of association
and habit, the characters of men are formed
by the instruction, conversation, and example of
those with whom they mix in society, or whose
ideas they imbibe in the course of their reading
and studies."<a name="FNanchor-4" id="FNanchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> Again: "As all men, in all nations,
are of the same species, are endowed with
the same senses and feelings, and receive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
perceptions and ideas through similar organs, the
difference, whether physical or moral, that is observed
in comparing different races or assemblages
of men, can arise only from external and
adventitious circumstances."<a name="FNanchor-5" id="FNanchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> The last position is
entirely dependent on the first; if we grant the
first, relating to individuals, the other follows as a
necessary consequence. For, if we assume that
the infinite intellectual diversities of individuals
are owing solely to external influences, it is self-evident
that the same diversities in nations, which
are but aggregations of individuals, must result
from the same causes. But are we prepared to
grant this first position&mdash;to assert that man is but
an automaton, whose wheelwork is entirely without&mdash;the
mere buffet and plaything of accident and
circumstances? Is not this the first step to gross
materialism, the first argument laid down by that
school, of which the great Locke has been stigmatized
as the father, because he also asserts that the
human mind is at first a blank tablet. But Locke
certainly could not mean that all these tablets
were the same and of equal value. A tablet of
wax receives an impression which one of marble
will not; on the former is easily effaced what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
other forever retains. We do not deny that circumstances
have a great influence in moulding
both moral and intellectual character, but we do
insist that there is a primary basis upon which
the degree of that influence depends, and which
is the work of God and not of man or chance.
What agriculturist could be made to believe that,
with the same care, all plants would thrive equally
well in all soils? To assert that the character of
a man, whether good or wicked, noble or mean, is
the aggregate result of influences over which he
has no control, is to deny that man is a free agent;
it is infinitely worse than the creed of the Buddhist,
who believes that all animated beings possess
a detached portion of an all-embracing intelligence,
which acts according to the nature and
capacity of the machine of clay that it, for the
time, occupies, and when the machine is worn out
or destroyed, returns, like a rivulet to the sea, to
the vast ocean of intelligence whence it came, and
in which again it is lost. In the name of common
sense, daily observation, and above all, of revelation,
we protest against a doctrine which paves
the road to the most absurd as well as anti-religious
conclusions. In it we recognize the fountain
whence flow all the varied forms and names
under which Atheism disguises itself. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
useless to enter any further upon the refutation of
an argument which few would be willing seriously
to maintain. It is one of those plausible speculations
which, once admitted, serve as the basis of
so many brilliant, but airy, theories that dazzle
and attract those who do not take the trouble of
examining their solidity.</p>

<p>Once we admit that circumstances, though they
may impede or favor the development of powers,
cannot give them; in other words, that they can
call into action, but cannot create, moral and intellectual
resources; no argument can be drawn
from the unity of species in favor of the mental
equality of races. If two men, the offspring of
the same parents, can be the one a dunce, the
other a genius, why cannot different races, though
descended of the same stock, be different also in
intellectual endowments? We should laugh at,
or rather, pity the man who would try to persuade
us that there is no difference in color, etc., between
the Scandinavian and the African, and yet it is by
some considered little short of heresy to affirm,
that there is an imparity in their minds as well as
in their bodies.</p>

<p>We are told&mdash;and the objection seems indeed
a grave one&mdash;that if we admit psychical as well
as physical gradations in the scale of human races,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the lowest must be so hopelessly inferior to the
higher, their perceptions and intellectual capacities
so dim, that even the light of the gospel
cannot illumine them. Were it so, we should at
once abandon the argument as one above human
comprehension, rather than suppose that God's
mercy is confined to any particular race or races.
But let us earnestly investigate the question. On
so vital a point the sacred record cannot but be
plain and explicit. To it let us turn. Man&mdash;even
the lowest of his species&mdash;has a soul. However
much defaced God's image, it is vivified
by His breath. To save that soul, to release it
from the bondage of evil, Christ descended upon
earth and gave to mankind, not a complicated
system of philosophy which none but the learned
and intellectual could understand, but a few
simple lessons and precepts, comprehensible to the
meanest capacity. He did not address himself to
the wise of this world, but bade them be like
children if they would come unto him. The
learned Pharisees of Judea jeered and ridiculed
him, but the poor woman of Canaan eagerly
picked up the precious crumbs of that blessed repast
which they despised. His apostles were chosen
from among the lowly and simple, his first followers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">[Pg 23]</a></span>belonged to that class. He himself hath said:<a name="FNanchor-6" id="FNanchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a>
"I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and
earth, because thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
babes." How then shall we judge of the degree
of intellect necessary to be a follower of Jesus?
Are the most intellectual, the best informed men
generally the best Christians? Or does the word
of God anywhere lead us to suppose that at the
great final judgment the learned prelate or ingenious
expositor of the faith will be preferred to
the humble, illiterate savage of some almost unknown
coast, who eagerly drinks of the living
water whereof whosoever drinketh shall never
thirst again?</p>

<p>This subject has met with the attention which
its importance deserves, at the hands of Mr.
Gobineau, and he also shows the fallacy of the
idea that Christianity will remove the mental
inequality of races. True religion, among all
nations who are blessed with it and sincerely
embrace it, will purify their morals, and establish
friendly relations between man and his fellow-man.
But it will not make an <em>intellectually</em> inferior
race equal to a superior one, because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
not designed to bestow talents or to endow with
genius those who are devoid of it. Civilization is
essentially the result of man's intellectual gifts,
and must vary in its character and degree like
them. Of this we shall speak again in treating of
the <em>specific differences of civilization</em>, when the term
<em>Christian civilization</em> will also be examined.</p>

<p>One great reason why so many refuse to recognize
mental as well as physical differences among
races, is the common and favorite belief of our
time in the infinite perfectibility of man. Under
various forms this development-theory, so flattering
to humanity, has gained an incredible number
of adherents and defenders. We believe ourselves
steadily marching towards some brilliant goal, to
which every generation brings us nearer. We
look with a pity, almost amounting to contempt,
upon those who preceded us, and envy posterity,
which we expect to surpass us in a ratio even
greater than we believe ourselves to surpass our
ancestors. It is indeed a beautiful and poetic idea
that civilization is a vast and magnificent edifice
of which the first generation laid the corner-stone,
and to which each succeeding age contributes new
materials and new embellishments. It is our tower
of Babel, by which we, like the first men after the
flood, hope to reach heaven and escape the ills of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
life. Some such idea has flattered all ages, but in
ours it has assumed a more definite form. We
point with pride to our inventions, annihilating&mdash;we
say&mdash;time and distance; our labor-saving machines
refining the mechanic and indirectly diffusing
information among all classes, and confidently
look forward to a new era close at hand, a millennium
to come. Let us, for a moment, divest ourselves
of the conceit which belongs to every age,
as well as to every country and individual; and
let us ask ourselves seriously and candidly: In
what are we superior to our predecessors? We
have inventions that they had not, it is true, and
these inventions increase in an astonishing ratio;
we have clearer ideas of the laws which govern
the material world, and better contrivances to
apply these laws and to make the elements subservient
to our comfort. But has the human mind
really expanded since the days of Pythagoras and
Plato? Has the thinker of the nineteenth century
faculties and perceptions which they had not?
Have we one virtue more or one vice less than
former generations? Has human nature changed,
or has it even modified its failings? Though
we succeed in traversing the regions of air as
easily and swifter than we now do broad continents
and stormy seas; though we count all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
worlds in the immensity of space; though we
snatch from nature her most recondite secrets,
shall we be aught but men? To the true philosopher
these conquests over the material world
will be but additional proofs of the greatness of
God and man's littleness. It is the vanity and
arrogance of the creature of clay that make him
believe that by his own exertions he can arrive at
God-like perfection. The insane research after
the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life may
be classed among the many other futile attempts
of man to invade the immutable decree: "Thus
far, and no farther." To escape from the moral and
intellectual imperfections of his nature, there is
but one way; the creature must humbly and devoutly
cast himself into the ever-open arms of the
Creator and seek for knowledge where none
knocketh in vain. This privilege he has enjoyed
in all ages, and it is a question which I would
hesitate to answer whether the progress of physical
science has not, in many cases at least, rather
the effect of making him self-sufficient and too
confident in his own powers, than of bringing him
nearer to the knowledge of the true God. It is
one of the fatal errors of our age in particular, to
confound the progress of physical science with a
supposed moral progress of man. Were it so, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Bible would have been a revelation of science as
well as of religion, and that it is not is now beginning
to be conceded, though by no means so generally
as true theology would require; for the law
of God was intended for every age, for every
country, for every individual, independent of the
state of science or a peculiar stage of civilization,
and not to be modified by any change which man
might make in his material existence. With due
deference, then, to those philosophers who assert
that the moral nature of the human species has
undergone a change at various periods of the
world's history; and those enthusiasts who dream
of an approaching millennium, we hold, that human
nature has always been the same and always
will be the same, and that no inventions or discoveries,
however promotive of his material well-being,
can effect a moral change or bring him
any nearer to the Divine essence than he was in
the beginning of his mundane existence. Science
and knowledge may indeed illumine his earthly
career, but they can shed no light upon the path
he is to tread to reach a better world.</p>

<p>Christ himself has recognized the diversity of
intellectual gifts in his parable of the talents, from
which we borrow the very term to designate those
gifts; and if, in a community of pure and faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Christians, there still are many degrees and kinds
of talents, is it reasonable to suppose that in that
millennium&mdash;the only one I can imagine&mdash;when all
nations shall call on His name with hope and praise,
all mental imparities of races will be obliterated?
There are, at the present time, nations upon whom
we look down as being inferior in civilization to
ourselves, yet they are as good&mdash;if, indeed, not
better&mdash;Christians than we are as a people. The
progress of physical science, by facilitating the
intercourse between distant parts of the world,
tends, indeed, to diffuse true religion, and in this
manner&mdash;and this manner only&mdash;promotes the
moral good of mankind. But here it is only an
instrument, and not an agent, as the machines
which the architect uses to raise his building
materials do not erect the structure.</p>

<p>One more reason why the unity of the human
species cannot be considered a proof of equal intellectual
capability of races. It is a favorite
method of naturalists to draw an analogy between
man and the brute creation; and, so far as he belongs
to the animal kingdom, this method is undoubtedly
correct and legitimate. But, with regard
to man's higher attributes, there is an impassable
barrier between him and the brute, which, in
the heat of argument, contending parties have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
always sufficiently respected. The great Prichard
himself seems sometimes to have lost sight of it.<a name="FNanchor-7" id="FNanchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
Thus, he speaks of "psychological" diversities in
varieties of the same undoubted species of animal,
though it is obvious that animals can have no
psychological attributes. But I am willing to
concede to Mr. Prichard all the conclusions he
derives from this analogy in favor of unity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
human species. All dogs, he believes, are derived
from one pair; yet, there are a number of varieties
of dogs, and these varieties are different not
only in external appearance, but in what Mr.
Prichard would call psychological qualities. No
shepherd expects to train a common cur to be the
intelligent guardian of a flock; no sportsman to
teach his hounds, or their unmixed progeny, to
perform the office of setters. That the characteristics
of every variety of dogs are permanent so
long as the breed remains pure, every one knows,
and that their distinctive type remains the same in
all countries and through all time, is proved by
the mural paintings of Egypt, which show that,
2,000 years B. C., they were as well known as in
our day.<a name="FNanchor-8" id="FNanchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> If, then, this permanency of "psychological"
(to take Mr. Prichard's ground) diversity
is compatible with unity of origin in the dog, why
not in the case of man? I am far from desiring to
call into question the unity of our species, but I
contend that the rule must work both ways, and
if "psychological" diversities can be permanent
in the branches of the same species of animals,
they can be permanent also in the branches of the
human family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
In the preceding pages, I have endeavored to
show that the unity of species is no proof of equal
intellectual capability of races, that mental imparities
do not conflict with the universality of
the gospel tidings, and that the permanency of
these imparities is consistent with the reasoning
of the greatest expounder of the unity theory. I
shall now proceed to state the facts which prove
the intellectual diversities among the races of man.
In doing so, it is important to guard against an
error into which so many able writers have fallen,
that of comparing individuals rather than masses.</p>

<p>What we term national character, is the aggregate
of the qualities preponderating in a community.
It is obvious that when we speak of the
artistic genius of the Greeks, we do not mean that
every native of Hellas and Ionia was an artist;
and when we call a nation unwarlike or valorous,
we do not thereby either stigmatize every individual
as a coward, or extol him as a hero. The
same is the case with races. When, for example,
we assert that the black race is intellectually inferior
to the white, it is not implied that the most
intelligent negro should still be more obtuse than
the most stupid white man. The maximum intellect
and capacity of one race may greatly exceed
the minimum of another, without placing them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
an equality. The testimony of history, and the
results of philanthropic experiment, are the data
upon which the ethnologist must institute his
inquiries, if he would arrive at conclusions instructive
to humanity.</p>

<p>Let us take for illustration the white and the
black races, supposed by many to represent the
two extremes of the scale of gradation. The
whole history of the former shows an uninterrupted
progress; that of the latter, monotonous
stagnation. To the one, mankind owes the most
valuable discoveries in the domain of thought,
and their practical application; to the other, it
owes nothing. For ages plunged in the darkest
gloom of barbarism, there is not one ray of even
temporary or borrowed improvement to cheer the
dismal picture of its history, or inspire with hope
the disheartened philanthropist. At the boundary
of its territory, the ever-encroaching spirit of
conquest of the European stops powerless.<a name="FNanchor-9" id="FNanchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> Never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in the history of the world, has a grander or more
conclusive experiment been tried than in the case
of the negro race. We behold them placed in
immediate possession of the richest island in
the richest part of the globe, with every advantage
that climate, soil, geographical situation,
can afford; removed from every injurious contact,
yet with every facility for constant intercourse
with the most polished nations of the earth;
inheriting all that the white race had gained by
the toil of centuries in science, politics, and morals;
and what is the result? As if to afford a still
more irrefragable proof of the mental inequality
of races, we find separate divisions of the same
island inhabited, one by the pure, the other by
a half-breed race; and the infusion of the white
blood in the latter case forms a population incontestably
and avowedly superior. In opposition to
such facts, some special pleader, bent upon establishing
a preconceived notion, ransacks the
records of history to find a few isolated instances
where an individual of the inferior race has displayed
average ability, and from such exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
cases he deduces conclusions applicable to the
whole mass! He points with exultation to a
negro who calculates, a negro who is an officer of
artillery in Russia, a few others who are employed
in a counting-house. And yet he does not even
tell us whether these <i>rar&aelig; aves</i> are of pure blood
or not, as is often the case.<a name="FNanchor-10" id="FNanchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> Moreover, these instances
are proclaimed to the world with an air of
triumph, as if they were drawn at random from
an inexhaustible arsenal of facts, when in reality
they are all that the most anxious research could
discover, and form the stock in trade of every
declaimer on the absolute equality of races.</p>

<p>Had it pleased the Creator to endow all branches
of the human family equally, all would then have
pursued the same career, though, perhaps, not all
with equal rapidity. Some, favored by circumstances,
might have distanced others in the race;
a few, peculiarly unfortunately situated, would
have lagged behind. Still, the progress of all
would have been in the same direction, all would
have had the same stages to traverse. Now is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the case? There are not a few who assert it.
From our earliest infancy we are told of the
savage, barbarous, semi-civilized, civilized, and
enlightened states. These we are taught to consider
as the steps of the ladder by which man
climbs up to infinite perfection, we ourselves being
near the top, while others are either a little below
us, or have scarcely yet firmly established themselves
upon the first rounds. In the beautiful language
of Schiller, these latter are to us a mirror
in which we behold our own ancestors, as an adult
in the children around him re-witnesses his own
infancy. This is, in a measure, true of nations of
the same race, but is it true with regard to different
races? It is little short of presumption to
venture to combat an idea perhaps more extensively
spread than any of our time, yet this we
shall endeavor to do. Were the differences in
civilization which we observe in various nations
of the world, differences of degree only, and not
of kind, it is obvious that the most advanced individual
in one degree must closely approach the
confines of a higher. But this is not the case.
The highest degree of culture known to Hindoo
or Chinese civilization, approaches not the possessor
one step nearer to the ideas and views of
the European. The Chinese civilization is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
perfect, in its own way, as ours, nay more so.<a name="FNanchor-11" id="FNanchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> It
is not a mere child, or even an adult not yet arrived
at maturity; it is rather a decrepit old man.
It too has its degrees; it too has had its periods
of infancy, of adult age, of maturity. And when
we contemplate its fruits, the immense works
which have been undertaken and completed
under its &aelig;gis, the systems of morals and politics
to which it gave rise, the inventions which signalized
its more vigorous periods, we cannot but
admit that it is entitled in a high degree to our
veneration and esteem.<a name="FNanchor-12" id="FNanchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> Moreover it has excellencies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">[Pg 37]</a></span>which our civilization as yet has not; it
pervades all classes, ours not. In the whole Chinese
empire, comprising, as it does, one-third of the
human race, we find few individuals unable to
read and write; in China proper, none. How many
European countries can pretend to this? And
yet, because Chinese civilization has a different
tendency from ours, because its course lies in another
direction, we call it a semi-civilization. At
what time of the world's history then have we&mdash;the
<em>civilized</em> nations&mdash;passed through this stage of
semi-civilization?</p>

<p>The monuments of Sanscrit literature, the magnificent
remains of palaces and temples, the great
number of ingenious arts, the elaborate systems of
metaphysics, attest a state of intellectual culture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
far from contemptible, among the Hindoos. Yet
their civilization, too, we term a semi-civilization,
albeit it is as little like the Chinese as it is like
anything ever seen in Europe.</p>

<p>Few who will carefully investigate and reflect
upon these facts, will doubt that the terms Hindoo,
Chinese, European civilization, are not indicative
of degrees only, but mean the respective
development of powers essentially different in
their nature. We may consider our civilization
the best, but it is both arrogant and unphilosophical
to consider it as the only one, or as the
standard by which to measure all others. This
idea, moreover, is neither peculiar to ourselves nor
to our age. The Chinese even yet look upon us
as barbarians; the Hindoos probably do the same.
The Greeks considered all extra-Hellenic peoples
as barbarians. The Romans ascribed the same
pre-excellency to themselves, and the predilections
for these nations, which we imbibe already in
our academic years from our classical studies,
cause us to share the same opinion, and to view
with their prejudices nations less akin to us than
they. The Persians, for instance, whom the
Greeks self-complacently styled outside-barbarians,
were, in reality, a highly cultivated people, as no
one can deny who will examine the facts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
modern research has brought to light. Their arts,
if not Hellenic, still attained a high degree of perfection.
Their architecture, though not of Grecian
style, was not inferior in magnificence and splendor.
Nay, I for one am willing to render myself
obnoxious to the charge of classical heresy, by
regarding the pure Persians as a people, in some
respects at least, superior to the Greeks. Their
religious system seems to me a much purer, nobler
one than the inconsistent, immoral mythology of
our favorites. Their ideas of a good and an evil
power in perpetual conflict, and of a mediator who
loves and protects the human race; their utter detestation
of every species of idolatry, have to me
something that prepossesses me in their favor.</p>

<p>I have now alleged, in a cursory manner, my
principal reasons for considering civilizations as
specifically distinct. To further dilate upon the
subject, though I greatly desire to do so, would
carry me too far; not, indeed, beyond the scope
of the inquiries proposed in this volume, but beyond
the limited space assigned for my introduction.
I shall add only, that&mdash;assuming the intellectual
equality of all branches of the human
family&mdash;we can assign no causes for the differences
of <em>degree only</em> of their development. Geographical
position cannot explain them, because the
people who have made the greatest advance, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
not always been the most favorably situated. The
greatest geographical advantages have been in
possession of others that made no use of them,
and became of importance only by changing owners.
To cite one of a thousand similar instances.
The glorious Mississippi Valley, with its innumerable
tributary streams, its unparalleled fertility
and mineral wealth, seems especially adapted by
nature for the abode of a great agricultural and
commercial nation. Yet, the Indians roamed over
it, and plied their canoes on its rivers, without ever
being aware of the advantages they possessed. The
Anglo-Saxon, on the contrary, no sooner perceived
them than he dreamed of the conquest of the world.
We may therefore compare such and other advantages
to a precious instrument which it requires
the skill of the workman to use. To ascribe differences
of civilizations to the differences of laws
and political institutions, is absolutely begging the
question, for such institutions are themselves an
effect and an inherent portion of the civilization,
and when transplanted into foreign soils, never
prosper. That the moral and physical well-being
of a nation will be better promoted when liberty
presides over her councils than when stern despotism
sits at the helm, no one can deny; but it is
obvious that the nation must first be prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
receive the blessings of liberty, lest they prove a
curse.</p>

<p>Here is the place for a few remarks upon the
epithet Christian, applied to our civilization. Mr.
Gobineau justly observes, that he knows of no
social or political order of things to which this term
may fitly be said to belong. We may justly speak of
a Brahminic, Buddhistic, Pagan, Judaic civilization,
because the social or political systems designated
by these appellations were intimately connected
with a more or less exclusive theocratical formula.
Religion there prescribed everything: social and
political laws, government, manners, nay, in many
instances, dress and food. But one of the distinguishing
characteristics of Christianity is its universality.
Right at the beginning it disclaimed
all interference in temporal affairs. Its precepts
may be followed under every system of government,
in every path of life, every variety of modes
of existence. Such is, in substance, Mr. Gobineau's
view of the subject. To this I would add a few
comments of my own. The error is not one of
recent date. Its baneful effects have been felt
from almost the first centuries of the establishment
of the Church down to our times. Human legislation
ought, indeed, to be in strict accordance with
the law of God, but to commend one system as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Christian, and proscribe another as unchristian, is
opening the door to an endless train of frightful
evils. This is what, virtually, they do who would
call a civilization Christian, for civilization is the
aggregate social and political development of a
nation, or a race, and the political is always in
direct proportion to the social progress; both
mutually influence each other. By speaking of a
Christian civilization, therefore, we assert that
some particular political as well as social system,
is most conformable to the spirit of our religion.
Hence the union of church and State, and the influence
of the former in temporal affairs&mdash;an influence
which few enlightened churchmen, at least
of our age, would wish to claim. Not to speak of
the danger of placing into the hands of any class
of men, however excellent, the power of declaring
what legislation is Christian or not, and thus investing
them with supreme political as well as
spiritual authority; it is sufficient to point out the
disastrous effects of such a system to the interests
of the church itself. The opponents of a particular
political organization become also the opponents
of the religion which advocates and defends it.
The indifferentism of Germany, once so zealous in
the cause of religion, is traceable to this source.
The people are dissatisfied with their political<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
machinery, and hate the church which vindicates
it, and stigmatizes as impious every attempt at
change. Indeed, one has but to read the religious
journals of Prussia, to understand the lukewarmness
of that people. Mr. Brace, in his <cite>Home Life
in Germany</cite>, says that many intelligent natives of
that country had told him: Why should we go to
church to hear a sermon that extols an order of
things which we know to be wicked, and in the
highest degree detestable? How can a religion
be true which makes adherence to such an order
a fundamental article of its creed?</p>

<p>One of the features of our constitution which
Mr. De Tocqueville most admires, is the utter
separation of church and State. Mere religious
toleration practically prevails in most European
countries, but this total disconnection of the religious
from the civil institutions, is peculiar to
the United States, and a lesson which it has given
to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I do not mean that every one who makes use of
the word Christian civilization thereby implies a
union of church and State, but I wish to point out
the principle upon which this expression is based,
viz: that a certain social and political order of things
is more according to the spirit of the Christian religion
than another; and the consequences which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
must, or at least may, follow from the practical
acceptation of this principle. Taking my view of
the subject, few, I think, will dispute that the term
Christian civilization is a misnomer. Of the civilizing
influence of Christianity, I have spoken before,
but this influence would be as great in the
Chinese or Hindoo civilizations, without, in the
least, obliterating their characteristic features.</p>

<p>Few terms of equal importance are so vaguely
defined as the term <strong class="smcap">civilization</strong>; few definitions
are so difficult. In common parlance, the word
civilization is used to designate that moral, intellectual,
and material condition at which the so-called
European race, whether occupying the Eastern
or the Western continent, has arrived in the
nineteenth century. But the nations comprised in
this race differ from one another so extensively, that
it has been found necessary to invent a new term:
<em>enlightenment</em>. Thus, Great Britain, France, the
United States, Switzerland, several of the States
of the German Confederacy, Sweden, and Denmark,
are called enlightened; while Russia, Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Brazil, and the South American
republics are merely civilized. Now, I ask, in
what does the difference consist?</p>

<p>Is the diffusion of knowledge by popular education
to be the test? Then Great Britain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
France would fall far below some countries now
placed in the second, or even third rank. Denmark
and China would be the most civilized countries
in the world; nay, even Thibet, and the rest of
Central Asia, would take precedence before the
present champions of civilization. The whole of
Germany and Switzerland would come next, then
the eastern and middle sections of the United States,
then the southern and western; and, after them,
Great Britain and France. Still retaining the
same scale, Russia would actually be ranked above
Italy, the native clime of the arts. In Great
Britain itself, Scotland would far surpass England
in civilization<a name="FNanchor-13" id="FNanchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Is the perfection to which the arts are carried,
the test of civilization? Then Bavaria and Italy<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden;"><a name="page47" id="page47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
are the most civilized countries. Then are we far
behind the Greeks in civilization. Or, are the
useful arts to carry the prize? Then the people
showing the greatest mechanical genius is the most
civilized.</p>

<p>Are political institutions to be the test? Then
the question, "Which is the best government?"
must first be decided. But the philosophic answer
would be: "That which is best adapted to the
genius of the people, and therefore best answers the
purposes for which all government is instituted."
Those who believe in the abstract superiority of
any governmental theory, may be compared to the
tailor who would finish some beau-ideal of a coat,
without taking his customer's measure. We could
afford to laugh at such theorists, were not their
schemes so often recorded in blood in the annals
of the world. Besides, if this test be admitted,
no two could agree upon what was a civilized
community. The panegyrist of constitutional
monarchy would call England the only civilized
country; the admirer of municipal liberty would
point to the Hanse towns of the Middle Ages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
their miserable relics, the present free cities of
Germany; the friend of sober republicanism would
exclude from the pale of civilization all but the
United States and Switzerland; the lover of pure
democracy would contend that mankind had retrograded
since the time of Athens, and deplore that
civilization was now confined to some few rude
mountain or nomadic tribes with few and simple
wants; finally, the defender of a paternal autocracy
would sigh for the days of Trajan or Marcus Aurelius,
and hesitate whether, in our age, Austria or
Russia deserved the crown.</p>

<p>Neither pre-eminence in arts and sciences, nor
in popular instruction, nor in government, can
singly be taken as the test of civilization. Pre-eminence
in all, no country enjoys. Yet all these
are signs of civilization&mdash;the only ones by which
we distinguish and recognize it. How, then, shall
we define this term? I would suggest a simple
and, I think, sufficiently explicit definition: Civilization
is the continuous development of man's
moral and intellectual powers. As the aggregate
of these differs in different nations, so differs the
character of their civilization. In one, civilization
manifests itself in the perfection of the arts, either
useful or polite; in another, in the cultivation of
the sciences; in a third; in the care bestowed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
politics, or, in the diffusion of knowledge among
the masses. Each has its own merits, each its own
defects; none combines the excellencies of all, but
whichever combines the most with fewest defects,
may be considered the best, or most perfect. It is
because not keeping this obvious truth in view
that John Bull laughs (or used to laugh) self-complacently
at Monsieur Crapaud, and that we ourselves
sometimes laugh at his political capers, forgetting
that the thinkers of his nation have, for
the last century at least, led the van in science and
politics&mdash;yes, even in politics.<a name="FNanchor-14" id="FNanchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> It is, for the same
reason, that the Frenchman laughs at the German,
or the Dutchman; that the foreigner cannot understand
that there is an <em>American civilization</em> as well,
and, bringing his own country's standard along
with him, finds everything either too little or too
great; or, that the American, going to the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
soil of the ripest scholars in the world, and seeing
brick and mortar carried up by hand to the fourth
story of a building in process of erection,<a name="FNanchor-15" id="FNanchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> or seeing
five men painfully perform a job which his youngest
son would have accomplished without trouble
by the simplest, perhaps self-invented, contrivance,
revolves in his own mind how it is possible that
these people&mdash;when the schoolmaster is abroad,
too&mdash;are still so many centuries "behind the time."
Thus each nation has its own standard by which
it judges its neighbors; but when extra-European
nations, such as the Chinese or Hindoos, are to be
judged, all unite in voting them <em>outside barbarians</em>.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have indubitable proofs of moral
and intellectual diversities, not only in what are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
generally termed different races, but even in nations
apparently belonging to the same race. Nor do I
see in this diversity ought that can militate against
our ideas of universal brotherhood. Among individuals,
diversity of talent does not preclude
friendly intercourse; on the contrary, it promotes
it, for rivals seldom are friends. Neither does
superior ability exempt us from the duties which
we owe to our fellow-man.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly made use of the analogy between
societies and the individuals that compose
them. I cannot more clearly express my idea of
civilization than by recurring to it again. Civilization,
then, is to nations what the development of
his physical and intellectual powers is to an individual;
indeed, it is nothing but the aggregate
result of all these individual powers; a common
reservoir to which each contributes a share, whether
large or small. The analogy may be extended
further. Nations may be considered as themselves
members of societies, bearing the same relations
to each other and to the whole, as individuals.
Thus, all the nations of Europe contribute, each
in its own manner and degree, to what has been
called the <em>European</em> civilization. And, in the same
manner, the nations of Asia form distinct systems of
civilizations. But all these systems ultimately tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to one great aim&mdash;the general welfare of mankind.
I would therefore carefully distinguish between
the civilizations of particular nations, of clusters
of nations, and of the whole of our species. To
borrow a metaphor from the mechanism of the
universe, the first are like the planets of a solar
system, revolving&mdash;though in different orbits, and
with different velocities&mdash;around the same common
centre; but the solar systems again&mdash;with all
their planets&mdash;revolve round another, more distant
point.</p>

<p>Let us take two individuals of undoubted intellect.
One may be a great mathematician, the other
a great statesman. Place the first at the head of
a cabinet, the second in an observatory, and the
mathematician will as signally fail in correctly
observing the changes in the political firmament,
as the other in noting those in the heavenly. Yet,
who would decide which had the superior intellect?
This diversity of gifts is not the result of education.
No training, however ingenious, could have
changed an Arago into a Pitt, or <i>vice versa</i>. Raphael
could under no circumstances have become
a Handel, or either of them a Milton. Nay, men
differ in following the same career. Can any one
conceive that Michael Angelo could ever have
painted Vandyke's pictures, Shakspeare written<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Milton's verses, Mozart composed Rossini's music,
or Jefferson followed Hamilton's policy? Here,
then, we have excellencies, perhaps of equal degree,
but of very different kinds. Nature, from
her inexhaustible store, has not only unequally,
but variously, bestowed her favors, and this infinite
variety of gifts, as infinite as the variety of faces,
God has doubtless designed for the happiness of
men, and for their more intimate union, in making
them dependent one on another. As each creature
sings his Maker's praise in his own voice and cadence,
the sparrow in his twitter, the nightingale
in her warble, so each human being proclaims the
Almighty's glory by the rightful use of his talents,
whether great or small, for the promotion of his
fellow-creatures' happiness; one may raise pious
emotion in the breast by the tuneful melody of his
song; another by the beauty and vividness of his
images on canvas or in verse; a third discovers
new worlds&mdash;additional evidences of His omnipotence
who made them&mdash;and, by his calculations,
demonstrates, even to the sceptic, the wonderful
mechanism of the universe; to another, again, it
is given to guide a nation's councils, and, by His
assistance, to avert danger, or correct evils. Fie
upon those who would raise man's powers above
those of God, and ascribe diversity of talents to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
education and accident, rather than to His wisdom
and design. Can we not admire the Almighty as
well in the variety as in a fancied uniformity of
His works? Harmony consists in the union of
different sounds; the harmony of the universe, in
the diversity of its parts.</p>

<p>What is true of a society composed of individuals,
is true of that vast political assemblage composed
of nations. That each has a career to run
through, a destiny to fulfil, is my firm and unwavering
belief. That each must be gifted with
peculiar qualities for that purpose, is a mere corollary
of the proposition. This has been the opinion
of all ages: "The men of B&oelig;otia are noted for
their stolidity, those of Attica for their wit." Common
parlance proves that it is now, to-day, the
opinion of all mankind, whatever theorists may
say. Many affect to deride the idea of "manifest
destiny" that possesses us Anglo-Americans, but
who in the main doubts it? Who, that will but
cast one glance on the map, or look back upon
our history of yesterday only, can think of seriously
denying that great purposes have been accomplished,
will still be accomplished, and that
these purposes were designed and guided by something
more than blind chance? Unroll the page
of history&mdash;of the great chain of human events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
it is true, we perceive but few links; like eternity,
its beginning is wrapt in darkness, its end a mystery
above human comprehension&mdash;but, in the
vast drama presented to us, in which nations form
the cast, we see each play its part, then disappear.
Some, as Mr. Gobineau has it, act the kings and
rulers, others are content with inferior roles.</p>

<p>As it is incompatible with the wisdom of the
Creator, to suppose that each nation was not specially
fitted<a name="FNanchor-16" id="FNanchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> for the part assigned to it, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
judge of what they were capable of by what they
have accomplished.</p>

<p>History, then, must be our guide; and never
was epoch more propitious, for never has her lamp
shone brighter. The study of this important
science, which Niebuhr truly calls the <i>magistra
vit&aelig;</i>, has received within our days an impulse
such as it never had before. The invaluable
arch&aelig;ological treasures which the linguists and
antiquarians of Europe have rescued from the
literature and monuments of the great nations of
former ages, bring&mdash;as it were&mdash;back to life again
the mouldered generations of the dim past. We
no longer content ourselves with chronological
outlines, mere names, and unimportant accounts
of kings and their quarrels; we seek to penetrate
into the inner life of those multitudes who acted
their part on the stage of history, and then disappeared,
to understand the modes of thought, the
feelings, ideas, <em>instincts</em>, which actuated them, and
made them what they were. The hoary pyramids
of the Nile valley are forced to divulge their age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the date of a former civilization; the temples and
sepulchres, to furnish a minute account of even
the private life of their builders;<a name="FNanchor-17" id="FNanchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> the arrow-headed
characters on the disinterred bricks of the sites of
Babylon and Nineveh, are no longer a secret to
the indefatigable orientalists; the classic writers
of Hindostan and China find their most zealous
scholiasts, and profoundest critics, in the capitals
of Western Europe. The dross of childish fables,
which age after age has transmitted to its successor
under the name of history, is exposed to the
powerful furnace of reason and criticism, and the
pure ore extracted, by such men as Niebuhr, Heeren,
Ranke, Gibbon, Grote. The enthusiastic lover of
ancient Rome now sees her early history in clearer,
truer colors than did her own historians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
But, if history is indispensable to ethnology,
the latter is no less so to a true understanding of
history. The two sciences mutually shed light on
one another's path, and though one of them is as
yet in its infancy, its wonderful progress in so
short a time, and the almost unparalleled attention
which it has excited at all hands, are bright omens
for the future. It will be obvious that, by <em>ethnology</em>,
we do not mean <em>ethnography</em>, with which it has long
been synonymous. Their meaning differs in the
same manner, they bear almost the same relation
to one another as <em>geology</em> and <em>geography</em>. While
ethnography contents herself with the mere description
and classification of the races of man, ethnology,
to borrow the expressive language of the
editor of the <cite>London Ethnological Journal</cite>, "investigates
the mental and physical differences of mankind,
and the organic laws upon which they depend;
seeks to deduce from these investigations
principles of human guidance, in all the important
relations of social and national existence."<a name="FNanchor-18" id="FNanchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> The
importance of this study cannot be better expressed
than in the words of a writer in the <cite>North British
Review</cite> for August, 1849: "No one that has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
worked much in the element of history, can be
aware of the immense importance of clearly keeping
in view the differences of race that are discernible
among the nations that inhabit different
parts of the world.... In speculative history,
in questions relating to the past career and the
future destinies of nations, <em>it is only by a firm and
efficient handling of this conception of our species, as
broken up into so many groups or masses, physiologically
different to a certain extent, that any progress
can be made, or any available conclusions accurately
arrived at</em>."<a name="FNanchor-19" id="FNanchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a></p>

<p>But in attempting to divide mankind into such
groups, an ethnologist is met by a serious and apparently
insurmountable difficulty. The gradation
of color is so imperceptible from the clearest white
to the jettest black; and even anatomical peculiarities,
normal in one branch, are found to exist,
albeit in exceptional cases, in many others; so
that the ethnographers scarce know where to stop
in their classification, and while some recognize
but three grand varieties, others contend for five,
for eleven, or even for a much greater number.
This difficulty arises, in my estimation, mainly
from the attempt to class mankind into different<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
species, that is, groups who have a separate origin;
and also, from the proneness to draw deductions
from individual instances, by which almost any
absurdity can be sustained, or truth refuted. As
we have already inveighed against the latter error,
and shall therefore try to avoid falling into it; and
as we have no desire to enter the field of discussion
about unity or plurality of species, we hope,
in a great measure, to obviate the difficulties that
beset the path of so many inquirers. By the word
<em>race</em><a name="FNanchor-20" id="FNanchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> we mean, both here and in the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
work, such branches of the human family as are
distinguished in the aggregate by certain well-defined
physical or mental peculiarities, independent
of the question whether they be of identical or
diverse origin. For the sake of simplicity, these
races are arranged in several principal classes, according
to their relative affinities and resemblances.
The most popular system of arrangement is that
of Blumenbach, who recognizes five grand divisions,
distinguished by appellations descriptive
either of color or geographical position, viz: the
White, Circassian, or European; the Yellow, Altaic,
Asiatic, or Mongolian; the Red, American,
or Indian; the Brown, or Malay; and, lastly, the
Black, African, or negro. This division, though
the most commonly adopted, has no superior claims
above any other. Not only are its designations
liable to very serious objections, but it is, in itself,
entirely arbitrary. The Hottentot differs as much
from the negro as the latter does from the Malay;
and the Polynesian from the Malay more than the
American from the Mongolian. Upon the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
principle, then, the number of classes might be
indefinitely extended. Mr. Gobineau thought three
classes sufficient to answer every purpose, and these
he calls respectively the white, yellow, and black.
Mr. Latham,<a name="FNanchor-21" id="FNanchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> the great ethnographer, adopts a
system almost precisely similar to our author's,
and upon grounds entirely different. Though, for
my own part, I should prefer a greater number of
primary divisions, I confess that this coincidence
of opinion in two men, pursuing, independent of,
and unknown to each other, different paths of investigation,
is a strong evidence of the correctness
of their system, which, moreover, has the merit
of great simplicity and clearness.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the races comprised
under these divisions, are by no means to
be considered equal among themselves. We should
lay it down as a general truth, that while the entire
groups differ principally in <em>degree</em> of intellectual
capacity, the races comprised in each differ
among themselves rather in kind. Thus, we assert
upon the testimony of history, that the white
races are superior to the yellow; and these, in turn,
to the black. But the Lithuanian and the Anglo-Saxon
both belong to the same group of races, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
yet, history shows that they differ; so do the Samoyede
and the Chinese, the negro of Lower
Guinea, and the Fellah. These differences, observable
among nations classed under the same head,
as, for instance, the difference between the Russians
and Italians (both white), we express in
every day's language by the word "genius." Thus,
we constantly hear persons speak of the artistic,
administrative, nautical genius of the Greeks, Romans,
and Phenicians, respectively; or, such
phrases as these, which I borrow from Mr. Gobineau:
"Napoleon rightly understood the <em>genius</em>
of his nation when he reinstated the Church, and
placed the supreme authority on a secure basis;
Charles I. and his adviser did not, when they attempted
to bend the neck of Englishmen under
the yoke of absolutism." But, as the word <em>genius</em>
applied to the capacities or tendencies of a nation,
in general implies either too much or too little, it
has been found convenient, in this work, to substitute
for it another term&mdash;<em>instinct</em>. By the use
of this word, it was not intended to assimilate man
to the brute, to express aught differing from intellect
or the reasoning capacity; but only to designate
the peculiar manner in which that intellect
or reasoning capacity manifests itself; in other
words, the special adaptation of a nation for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
part assigned to it in the world's history; and, as
this part is performed involuntarily and, for the
most part, unconsciously, the term was deemed
neither improper nor inappropriate. I do not,
however, contend for its correctness, though I
could cite the authority of high names for its use
in this sense; I contend merely for its convenience,
for we thereby gain an easy method of making
distinctions of <em>kind</em> in the mental endowments of
races, in cases where we would hesitate to make
distinctions of <em>degree</em>. In fact, it is saying of multitudes
only what we say of an individual by
speaking of his <em>talent</em>; with this difference, however,
that by talent we understand excellency of
a certain order, while instinct applies to every
grade. Two persons of equal intellectual calibre
may have, one a talent for mathematics, the other
for literature; that is, one can exhibit his intellect
to advantage only in calculation, the other only in
writing. Thus, of two nations standing equally
high in the intellectual scale, one shall be distinguished
for the high perfection attained in the fine
arts, the other for the same perfection in the useful.</p>

<p>At the risk of wearying the reader with my
definitions, I must yet inflict on him another
which is essential to the right understanding of the
following pages. In common parlance, the terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<em>nation</em> and <em>people</em> have become strictly synonymous.
We speak indifferently of the French people, or
the French nation; the English people, or the
English nation. If we make any distinction at
all, we perhaps designate by the first expression
the masses; by the second, rather the sovereignty.
Thus, we say the French people are versatile, the
French nation is at war with Russia. But even
this distinction is not always made.</p>

<p>My purpose is to restore the word nation to its
original signification, in which it expresses the
same as the word race, including, besides, the idea
of some sort of political organization. It is, in
fact, nothing but the Latin equivalent of that
word, and was applied, like tribe, to a collection
of individuals not only living under the same government,
but also claiming a closer consanguinity
to one another than to their neighbors. It differs
from tribe only in this respect, that it is applied to
greater multitudes, as for instance to a coalescence
of several closely-allied tribes, which gives rise to
more complicated political forms. It might therefore
be defined by an ethnologist as <em>a population
consisting of homogeneous ethnical elements</em>.</p>

<p>The word <em>people</em>, on the contrary, when applied
to an aggregation of individuals living under the
same government, implies no immediate consanguineous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ties among them. <em>Nation</em> does not necessarily
imply political unity; <em>people</em>, always. Thus,
we speak of the Greek <em>nation</em>, though the Greeks
were divided into a number of independent and
very dissimilar sovereignties; but, we say the
Roman <em>people</em>, though the whole population of the
empire obeyed the same supreme head. The Russian
empire contains within its limits, besides the
Russians proper, an almost equal number of Cossacks,
Calmucks, Tartars, Fins, and a number of
other races, all very different from one another
and still more so from the Russians, not only in
language and external appearance, but in manners,
modes of thinking: in one word, in instincts. By
the expression Russian people I should therefore
understand the whole population of that empire; by
Russian nation, only the dominant race to which
the Czar belongs. It is hardly possible to exaggerate
the importance of keeping in view this distinction,
as I shall prove by another instance. The
Hungarian people are very nearly equally divided
(exclusive of about one million Germans) into two
nations, the Magyars and the Sclaves. Not only
have these two, though for centuries occupying the
same soil, remained unmixed and distinct, but the
most intense antipathy exists between them, which
only requires an occasion to display itself in acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of bloodshed and relentless cruelty, that would
make the tenants of hell shudder. Such an occasion
was the recent revolution, in which, while the
Magyars fought like lions for their independence,
the Sclaves, knowing that they would not participate
in any advantage the others might gain,
proved more formidable opponents than the Austrians.<a name="FNanchor-22" id="FNanchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a></p>

<p>If I have been successful in my discrimination
between the two words, it follows plainly that a
member of one nation, strictly speaking, can no
more become a member of another by process of
law, than a man, by adopting a child, can make it
the fruit of his loins. This rule, though correct
in the abstract, does not always apply to individual
cases; but these, as has already been remarked,
cannot be made the groundwork of general deductions.
In conclusion of this somewhat digressional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">[Pg 68]</a></span>definition, I would observe that, owing to
the great intermixture of the European populations,
produced by their various and intimate mutual
relations, it does not apply with the same
force to them as to others, and this I regard as the
reason why the signification of the word has become
modified.</p>

<p>If we will carefully examine the history of great
empires, we shall be able, in almost every instance,
to trace their beginning to the activity of what, in
the strictest sense of the word, may be called a
nation. Gradually, as the sphere of that nation
expands, it incorporates, and in course of time
amalgamates with foreign elements.</p>

<p>Nimrod, we learn from sacred history, established
the Assyrian empire. At first, this consisted of but
little more than the city of Babylon, and must necessarily
have contained a very homogeneous population,
if from no other cause than its narrow geographical
limits. At the dawn of profane history, however,
we find this empire extending over boundless
tracts, and uniting under one rule tribes and nations
of the most dissimilar manners and tongues.</p>

<p>The Assyrian empire fell, and that of the Medes
rose on its ruins. The Median monarchy had an
humble beginning. Dejoces, says tradition, united
the independent tribes of the Medes. Later, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
find them ruling nations whose language they did
not understand, whose manners they despised.</p>

<p>The Persian empire exceeded in grandeur its
mighty predecessors. Originating in a rebellion of
a few liberty-loving tribes, concerted and successfully
executed by a popular leader (Cyrus), two
generations of rulers extended its boundaries to the
banks of the Nile. In Alexander's time, it was a
conglomeration of a countless number of nations,
many of whom remained under their hereditary
rulers while rendering allegiance, and paying tribute
to the great king.</p>

<p>I pass over the Macedonian empire, as of too
short a duration to be a fair illustration. The
germ of the Roman empire consisted of a coalescence
of very closely allied tribes: Romulus's
band of adventurers (who must have come from
neighboring communities), the Sabines, Albans, and
Latins. At the period of its downfall, it ruled, at
least nominally, over every then known race.</p>

<p>In all these instances, the number of which
might be further increased, we find homogeneousness
of population at first, ethnical mixture and
confusion at the end. "But what does this prove?
will be asked. That too great an extension of territory
is the cause of weakness? The idea is old,
and out of date in our times, when steam and electricity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">[Pg 70]</a></span>bring the outskirts of the largest empire
in closer proximity than formerly were the frontiers
of the humblest sovereignty." Extension of
territory does not itself prove a cause of weakness
and ruin. The largest empire in the world is that
of China, and, without steam or electricity, it has
maintained itself for 4,000 years, and bids fair, spite
of the present revolution, to last a good long while
yet. But, when extension of territory is attended
with the incorporation of heterogeneous masses,
having different interests, different instincts, from
the conqueror, then indeed the extension must be
an element of weakness, and not of strength.</p>

<p>The armies which Xerxes led into Greece were
not Persians; but a small fragment of that motley
congregation, the <em>&eacute;lite</em>, the leaven of the whole
mass, was composed of the king's countrymen.
Upon this small body he placed his principal reliance,
and when, at the fatal battle of Salamis, he
beheld the slaughter of that valiant and noble
band, though he had hundreds of thousands yet at
his command, he rent his garments and fled a
country which he had well-nigh conquered. Here
is the difference between the armies of Cyrus and
those of Xerxes and Darius. The rabbles which
obeyed the latter, perhaps contained as much valor
as the ranks of the enthusiastic followers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
first, though the fact of their fighting under Persian
standards might be considered as a proof of
their inferiority. But what interest had they in the
success of the great king? To forge still firmer
their own fetters? Could the name of Cyrus, the
remembrance of the storming of Sardis, the siege
of Babylon, the conquest of Egypt, fire them with
enthusiasm? Perhaps, in some of those glorious
events, their forefathers became slaves to the tyrants
they now serve, tyrants whose very language they
do not understand.</p>

<p>The last armies of tottering Rome were drafted
from every part of her boundless dominions, and
of the men who were sent to oppose the threatening
barbarians of the north, some, it might
be, felt the blood of humbled Greece in their
veins; some had been torn from a distant home
in Egypt, or Libya; others, perhaps, remembered
with pride how their ancestors had fought the
Romans in the times of Juba, or Mithridates;
others, again, boiled with indignation at the oppression
of their Gallic brethren;&mdash;could those men respect
the glorious traditions of Rome, could they
be supposed to emulate the former legions of the
proud city?</p>

<p>It is not, then, an extensive territory that ruins
nations; it is a diversity of instincts, a clashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of interests among the various parts of the population.
When each province is isolated in feelings
and interests from every other, no external
foe is wanted to complete the ruin. Ambitious
and adroit men will soon arise who know how to
play upon these interests, and employ them for the
promotion of their own schemes.</p>

<p>Nations, in the various stages of their career,
have often been compared to individuals. They
have, it is said, their period of infancy, of youth,
of manhood, of old age. But the similitude, however
striking, is not extended further, and, while
individuals die a natural death, nations are supposed
always to come to a violent end. Probably,
we do not like to concede that all nations, like
all individuals, must ultimately die a natural
death, even though no disease anticipates it;
because we dislike to recognize a rule which
must apply to us as well. Each nation fancies
its own vitality imperishable. When we are
young, we seldom seriously think of death; in the
same manner, societies in the period of their youthful
vigor and energy, cannot conceive the possibility
of their dissolution. In old age and decrepitude,
they are like the consumptive patient,
who, while fell disease is severing the last thread
that binds him to the earth, is still forming plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
for years to come. Falling Rome dreamed herself
eternal. Yet, the mortality of nations admits of
precisely the same proof as that of individuals&mdash;universal
experience. The great empires that
overshadowed the world, where are they? The
memory of some is perpetuated in the hearts of
mankind by imperishable monuments; of others,
the slightest trace is obliterated, the vaguest remembrance
vanished. As the great individual
intelligences, whose appearance marks an era in
the history of human thought, live in the minds
of posterity, even though no gorgeous tombstone
points out the resting-place of their hull of clay;
while the mausoleum of him whose grandeur was
but temporary, whose influence transient only,
carries no meaning on its sculptured surface to
after ages; even so the ancient civilizations which
adorned the globe, if their monuments be not in
the domain of thought, their gigantic vestiges
serve but to excite the wonder of the traveller
and antiquary, and perplex the historian. Their
sepulchres, however grand, are mute.<a name="FNanchor-23" id="FNanchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Many have been the attempts to detect the causes
why nations die, in order to prevent that catastrophe;
as the physicians of the Middle Ages, who
thought death was always the consequence of disease,
sought for the panacea that was to cure all ills
and thus prolong life forever. But nations, like individuals,
often survive the severest attacks of the
most formidable disease, and die without sickness.
In ancient times, those great catastrophes which
annihilated the political existence of millions, were
regarded as direct interpositions of Providence,
visiting in its wrath the sins of a nation, and
erecting a warning example for others; just as the
remarkable destruction of a noted individual, or
the occurrence of an unusual phenomenon was, and
by many is even now, ascribed to the same immediate
agency. But when philosophy discovered
that the universe is governed by pre-established,
immutable laws, and refused to credit miracles not
sanctioned by religion; then the dogma gained
ground that punishment follows the commission of
sin, as effect does the cause; and national calamities
had to be explained by other reasons. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
then said, nations die of luxury, immorality, bad
government, irreligion, etc. In other words, success
was made the test of excellency and failure of
crime. If, in individual life, we were to lay it
down as an infallible rule, that he who commits
no excesses lives forever, or at least very long;
and he who does, will immediately die; that he
who is honest in his dealings, will always prosper
more than he who is not; we should have a very
fluctuating standard of morality, since it has pleased
God to sometimes try the good by severe afflictions,
and let the wicked prosper. We should therefore
be often called upon to admire what is deserving
of contempt or punishment, and to seek for guilt
in the innocent. This is what we do in nations.
Wicked institutions have been called good, because
they were attended with success; good ones have
been pronounced bad, because they failed.</p>

<p>A more critical study of history has demonstrated
the fallibility of this theory, which is
now in a great measure discarded, and another
adopted in its stead. It is argued that, at a certain
period in its existence, a nation infallibly
becomes degenerated, and thus falls. But, asks
Mr. Gobineau, what is degeneracy? A nation
is said to be degenerated when the virtues of its
ancestry are lost. But why are they lost? Because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76">[Pg 76]</a></span>the nation is degenerated. Is not this like
the reasoning in the child's story-book: Why is
Jack a bad boy? Because he disobeys his parents.
Why does he disobey his parents? Because
he is a bad boy.</p>

<p>It is necessary, then, to show what degeneracy
is. This step in advance, Mr. Gobineau attempts
to make. He shows that each race is distinguished
by certain capabilities, which, if its civilizing genius
is sufficiently strong to enable it to assume a rank
among the nations of the world, determine the
character of its social and political development.
Like the Phenicians, it may become the merchant
and barterer of the world; or, like the Greeks, the
teacher of future generations; or, like the Romans,
the model-giver of laws and forms. Its part in the
drama of history may be an humble one or a
proud, but it is always proportionate to its powers.
These powers, and the instincts or aspirations
which spring from them, never change as long
as the race remains pure. They progress and
develop themselves, but never alter their nature.
The purposes of the race are always the same.
It may arrive at great perfection in the useful
arts, but, without infiltration of a different element,
will never be distinguished for poetry, painting,
sculpture, etc.; and <i>vice versa</i>. Its nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
may be belligerent, and it will always find causes
for quarrel; or it may be pacific, and then it will
manage to live at peace, or fall a prey to a neighbor.</p>

<p>In the same manner, the government of a race
will be in accordance with its instincts, and here
I have the weighty authority of the author of
<cite>Democracy in America</cite>, in my favor, and the author's
whom I am illustrating. "A government,"
says De Tocqueville,<a name="FNanchor-24" id="FNanchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> "retains its sway over a great
number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and
rational consent of the multitude, than by that <em>instinctive</em>,
and, to a certain extent, involuntary agreement,
which results from similarity of feelings, and
resemblances of opinions. I will never admit that
men constitute a social body, simply because they
obey the same head and the same laws. A society
can exist only when a great number of men consider
a great number of things in the same point
of view; when they hold the same opinions upon
many subjects, and when the same occurrences
suggest the same thoughts and impressions to their
minds." The laws and government of a nation are
always an accurate reflex of its manners and modes
of thinking. "If, at first, it would appear," says
Mr. Gobineau, "as if, in some cases, they were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
production of some superior individual intellect,
like the great law-givers of antiquity; let the facts
be more carefully examined, and it will be found
that the law-giver&mdash;if wise and judicious&mdash;has contented
himself with consulting the genius of his
nation, and giving a voice to the common sentiment.
If, on the contrary, he be a theorist like
Draco, his system remains a dead letter, soon to be
superseded by the more judicious institutions of a
Solon who aims to give to his countrymen, not the
best laws possible, but the best he thinks them
capable of receiving." It is a great and a very
general error to suppose that the sense of a nation
will always decide in favor of what we term "popular"
institutions, that is to say, such in which each
individual shares more or less immediately in the
government. Its genius may tend to the establishment
of absolute authority, and in that case the
autocrat is but an impersonation of the <i>vox populi</i>,
by which he must be guided in his policy. If he
be too deaf or rash to listen to it, his own ruin
will be the inevitable consequence, but the nation
persists in the same career.</p>

<p>The meaning of the word degeneracy is now
obvious. This inevitable evil is concealed in the
very successes to which a nation owes its splendor.
Whether, like the Persians, Romans, &amp;c., it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
swallowed up and absorbed by the multitudes its
arms have subjected, or whether the ethnical mixture
proceeds in a peaceful manner, the result is
the same. Even where no foreign conquests add
suddenly hundreds of thousands of a foreign population
to the original mass, the fertility of uncultivated
fields, the opulence of great commercial
cities, and all the advantages to be found in the
bosom of a rising nation, accomplish it, if in a
less perceptible, in a no less certain manner. The
two young nations of the world are now the United
States and Russia. See the crowds which are
thronging over the frontiers of both. Both already
count their foreign population by millions. As
the original population&mdash;the initiatory element of
the whole mass&mdash;has no additions to its numbers
but its natural increase, it follows that the influent
elements must, in course of time, be of equal
strength, and the influx still continuing, finally
absorb it altogether. Sometimes a nation establishes
itself upon the basis of a much more numerous
conquered population, as in the case of
the Frankish conquerors of Gaul; then the amalgamation
of ranks and classes produces the same
results as foreign immigration. It is clear that
each new ethnical element brings with it its own
characteristics or instincts, and according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
relative strength of these will be the modifications
in government, social relations, and the whole
tendencies of the race. The modifications may be
for the better, they may be for the worse; they
may be very gradual, or very sudden, according
to the merit and power of the foreign influence;
but in course of time they will amount to radical,
positive changes, and then the original nation has
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>This is the natural death of human societies.
Sometimes they expire gently and almost imperceptibly;
oftener with a convulsion and a
crash. I shall attempt to explain my meaning
by a familiar simile. A mansion is built
which in all respects suits the taste and wants of
the owner. Succeeding generations find it too
small, too dark, or otherwise ill adapted to their
purposes. Respect for their progenitor, and
family association, prevent, at first, very extensive
changes, still each one makes some; and as these
associations grow fainter, the changes become
more radical, until at last nothing of the old house
remains. But if it had previously passed into the
hands of a stranger, who had none of these associations
to venerate and respect, he would probably
have pulled it down at once and built another.</p>

<p>An empire, then, falls, when the vitalizing principle

parts are connected by none but artificial ties, and
artificial ties are all those which unite races possessed
of different instincts. This idea is expressed
in the beautiful image of the inspired prophet,
when he tells the mighty king that great truth,
which so many refuse to believe, that all earthly
kingdoms must perish until "the God of Heaven
set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed."<a name="FNanchor-25" id="FNanchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a>
"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image.
This great image, whose brightness was excellent,
stood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible.
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and
his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of
brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and
part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was
cut without hands, which smote the image upon
his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake
them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the
brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces
together, and became like the chaff of the summer

<p>I have now illustrated, to the best of my abilities,
several of the most important propositions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Mr. Gobineau, and attempted to sustain them by
arguments and examples different from those used
by the author. For a more perfect exposition I
must refer the reader to the body of the work.
My purpose was humbly to clear away such obstacles
as the author has left in the path, and remove
difficulties that escaped his notice. The task
which I have set myself, would, however, be far
from accomplished, were I to pass over what I
consider a serious error on his part, in silence and
without an effort at emendation.</p>

<p>Civilization, says Mr. Gobineau, arises from the
combined action and mutual reaction of man's
moral aspirations, and the pressure of his material
wants. This, in a general sense, is obviously true.
But let us see the practical application. I shall
endeavor to give a concise abstract of his views,
and then to point out where and why he errs.</p>

<p>In some races, says he, the spiritual aspirations
predominate over their physical desires,
in others it is the reverse. In none are either
entirely wanting. According to the relative proportion
and intensity of either of these influences,
which counteract and yet assist each
other, the tendency of the civilization varies. If
either is possessed in but a feeble degree, or if
one of them so greatly outweighs the other as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
completely neutralize its effects, there is no civilization,
and never can be one until the race is
modified by intermixture with one of higher endowments.
But if both prevail to a sufficient extent,
the preponderance of either one determines
the character of the civilization. In the Chinese,
it is the material tendency that prevails, in the
Hindoo the other. Consequently we find that in
China, civilization is principally directed towards
the gratification of physical wants, the perfection
of material well-being. In other words, it is of an
eminently utilitarian character, which discourages
all speculation not susceptible of immediate practical
application.</p>

<p>This well describes the Chinese, and is precisely
the picture which M. Huc, who has lived
among them for many years, and has enjoyed
better opportunities for studying their genius
than any other writer, gives of them in his late
publication.<a name="FNanchor-27" id="FNanchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Hindoo culture, on the contrary, displays a
very opposite tendency. Among that nation,
everything is speculative, nothing practical. The
toils of human intellect are in the regions of
the abstract where the mind often loses itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
in depths beyond its sounding. The material wants
are few and easily supplied. If great works are
undertaken, it is in honor of the gods, so that
even their physical labor bears homage to the invisible
rather than the visible world. This also
is a tolerably correct picture.</p>

<p>He therefore divides all races into these two
categories, taking the Chinese as the type of the
one and the Hindoos as that of the other. According
to him, the yellow races belong pre-eminently
to the former, the black to the latter, while the
white are distinguished by a greater intensity and
better proportion of the qualities of both. But this
division, and no other is consistent with the author's
proposition, by assuming that in the black
races the moral preponderates over the physical
tendency, comes in direct conflict not only with the
plain teachings of anatomy, but with all we know
of the history of those races. I shall attempt to
show wherein Mr. Gobineau's error lies, an error
from the consequences of which I see no possibility
for him to escape, and suggest an emendation which,
so far from invalidating his general position, tends
rather to confirm and strengthen it. In doing so,
I am actuated by the belief that even if I err, I
may be useful by inviting others more capable to
the task of investigation. Suggestions on important<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
subjects, if they serve no other purpose than to provoke
inquiry, are never useless. The alchemists
of the Middle Ages, in their frivolous pursuit of
impossibilities, discovered many invaluable secrets
of nature and laid the foundation of that science
which, by explaining the intimate mutual action
of all natural bodies, has become the indispensable
handmaiden of almost every other.</p>

<p>The error, it seems to me, lies in the same confusion
of distinct ideas, to which I had already
occasion to advert. In ordinary language, we
speak of the physical and moral nature of man,
terming physical whatever relates to his material,
and moral what relates to his immaterial being.
Again, we speak of <em>mind</em>, and though in theory we
consider it as a synonyme of soul, in practical application
it has a very different signification. A
person may cultivate his mind without benefiting
his soul, and the term <em>a superior mind</em>, does not
necessarily imply moral excellency. That mental
qualifications or acquisitions are in no way connected
with sound morality or true piety, I have
pointed out before. Should any further illustrations
be necessary, I might remark that the greatest
monsters that blot the page of history, have
been, for the most part, men of what are called
superior minds, of great intellectual attainments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Indeed, wickedness is seldom very dangerous, unless
joined to intellect, as the common sense of
mankind has expressed in the adage that a fool is
seldom a knave. We daily see men perverting
the highest mental gifts to the basest purposes, a
fact which ought to be carefully weighed by those
who believe that education consists in the cultivation
of the intellect only. I therefore consider the
moral endowments of man as practically different
from the mental or intellectual, at least in their
manifestations, if not in their essence. To define
my idea more clearly, let me attempt to explain
the difference between what I term the moral and
the intellectual nature of man. I am aware of the
dangerous nature of the ground I am treading, but
shall nevertheless make the attempt to show that
it is in accordance with the spirit of religion to
consider what in common parlance is called the
moral attributes of man, and which would be
better expressed by the word <em>psychical</em>, as divisible
into two, the strictly moral, and the intellectual.</p>

<p>The former is what leads man to look beyond his
earthly existence, and gives even the most brutish
savage some vague idea of a Deity. I am making
no rash or unfounded assertion when I declare,
Mr. Locke's weighty opinion to the contrary notwithstanding,
that no tribe has ever been discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">[Pg 88]</a></span>in which some notion of this kind, however
rude, was wanting, and I consider it innate&mdash;a
yearning, as it were, of the soul towards the regions
to which it belongs. The feeling of religion is
implanted in our breast; it is not a production of
the intellect, and this the Christian church confirms
when it declares that <em>faith</em> we owe to the grace of
God.</p>

<p>Intellect is that faculty of soul by which it
takes cognizance of, classes and compares the facts
of the <em>material</em> world. As all perceptions are derived
through the senses, it follows that upon the
nicety of these its powers must in a great measure
depend. The vigor and delicacy of the nerves, and
the size and texture of the brain in which they all
centre, form what we call native intellectual gifts.
Hence, when the body is impaired, the mind suffers;
"mens sana in corpore sano;" hence, a fever prostrates,
and may forever destroy, the most powerful
intellect; a glass of wine may dim and distort it.
Here, then, is the grand distinction between soul
and mind. The latter, human wickedness may
annihilate; the former, man killeth not. I should
wish to enter more fully upon this investigation, not
new, indeed, in speculative science, yet new in the
application I purpose to make of it, were it not for
fear of wearying my reader, to whom my only<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
apology can be, that the discussion is indispensable
to the proper investigation of the moral and intellectual
diversities of races. When I say moral
diversities, I do not mean that man's moral endowments,
strictly speaking, are unequal. This assertion
I am not prepared to make, because&mdash;as religion
is accessible and comprehensible to them all&mdash;it
may be supposed that these are in all cases
equal. But I mean that the manifestation of these
moral endowments varies, owing to causes which
I am now about to consider. I have said that the
moral nature of man leads him to look beyond the
confines of the material world. This, when not
assisted by revelation, he attempts to do by means
of his intellect. The intellect is, as it were, the
visual organ by which the soul scans the abyss
between the present and the future existence. According
to the dimness or brightness of this mental
eye, are his perceptions. If the intellectual
capacity is weak, he is content with a grovelling
conception of the Deity; if powerful, he erects an
elaborate fabric of philosophical speculations. But,
as the Almighty has decreed that human intellect,
even in its sublimest flight, cannot soar to His
presence; it follows that the most elaborate fabric
of the philosopher is still a <em>human</em> fabric, that the
most perfect human theology is still <em>human</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
hence&mdash;the necessity of revelation. This divine
light, which His mercy has vouchsafed us, dispenses
with, and eclipses, the feeble glimmerings of human
intellect. It illumines as well the soul of the rude
savage as of the learned theologian; of the illiterate
as of the erudite. Nay, very often the former has
the advantage, for the erudite philosopher is prone
to think his own lamp all-sufficient. If it be objected
that a highly cultivated mind, if directed to
rightful purposes, will assist in gaining a <em>nobler</em>
conception of the Deity, I shall not contradict, for
in the study of His works, we learn still more to
admire the Maker. But I insist that true piety
can, and does exist without it, and let those who
trust so much in their own powers beware lest
they lean upon a broken staff.</p>

<p>The strictly moral attributes of man, therefore,
those attributes which enable him to communicate
with his Maker, are common&mdash;probably in equal
degree&mdash;to all men, and to all races of men. But
his communications with the external world depend
on his physical conformation. The body is the
connecting link between the spirit and the material
world, and, by its intimate relations to both,
specially adapted to be the means of communication
between them. There seems to me nothing
irrational or irreligious in the doctrine that, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">[Pg 91]</a></span>to the perfectness of this means of communication,
must be the intercourse between the two.
A person with dull auditory organs can never
appreciate music, and whatever his talents otherwise
may be, can never become a Meyerbeer or a
Mozart. Upon quickness of perception, power of
analysis and combination, perseverance and endurance,
depend our intellectual faculties, both in their
degree and their kind; and are not they blunted
or otherwise modified in a morbid state of the body?
I consider it therefore established beyond dispute,
that a certain general physical conformation is
productive of corresponding mental characteristics.
A human being, whom God has created with a
negro's skull and general <em>physique</em>, can never equal
one with a Newton's or a Humboldt's cranial
development, though the soul of both is equally
precious in the eyes of the Lord, and should be in
the eyes of all his followers. There is no tendency
to materialism in this idea; I have no sympathy
with those who deny the existence of the soul,
because they cannot find it under the scalpel, and
I consider the body not the mental agent, but the
servant, the tool.</p>

<p>It is true that science has not discovered, and
perhaps never will discover, what physical differences
correspond to the differences in individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
minds. Phrenology, starting with brilliant promises,
and bringing to the task powers of no mean order,
has failed. But there is a vast difference between the
characteristics by which we distinguish individuals
of the same race, and those by which we distinguish
races themselves. The former are not strictly&mdash;at
least not immediately&mdash;hereditary, for the child
most often differs from both parents in body and
mind, because no two individuals, as no two leaves
of one tree, are precisely alike. But, although every
oak-leaf differs from its fellow, we know the leaf of
the oak-tree from that of the beech, or every other;
and, in the same manner, races are distinguished by
peculiarities which are hereditary and permanent.
Thus, every negro differs from every other negro,
else we could not tell them apart; yet all, if pure
blood, have the same characteristics in common
that distinguish them from the white. I have
been prolix, but intentionally so, in my discrimination
between individual distinction and those of
race, because of the latter, comparative anatomy
takes cognizance; the former are left to phrenology,
and I wished to remove any suspicion that
in the investigation of moral and intellectual diversities
of races, recourse must be had to the ill-authenticated
speculations of a dubious science.
But, from the data of comparative anatomy, attained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93">[Pg 93]</a></span>by a slow and cautious progress, we deduce
that races are distinguished by certain permanent
physical characteristics; and, if these physical
characteristics correspond to the mental, it follows
as an obvious conclusion that the latter are permanent
also. History ratifies the conclusion, and the
common sense of mankind practically acquiesces
in it.</p>

<p>To return, then, to our author. I would add
to his two elements of civilization a third&mdash;intellect
<i>per se</i>; or rather, to speak more correctly, I
would subdivide one of his elements into two, of
which one is probably dependent on physical conformation.
The combinations will then be more
complex, but will remove every difficulty.</p>

<p>I remarked that although we may consider all
races as possessed of equal moral endowments, we
yet may speak of moral diversities; because, without
the light of revelation, man has nothing but
his intellect whereby to compass the immaterial
world, and the manifestation of his moral faculties
must therefore be in proportion to the clearness
of his intellectual, and their preponderance
over the animal tendencies. The three I consider
as existing about in the following relative proportions
in the three great groups under which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Gobineau and Mr. Latham<a name="FNanchor-28" id="FNanchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> have arranged the
various races&mdash;a classification, however, which, as
I already observed, I cannot entirely approve.</p>

</div>


<p>But the races comprised in each group vary
among themselves, if not with regard to the relative
proportion in which they possess the elements
of civilization, at least in their intensity.
The following formulas will, I think, apply to the
majority of cases, and, at the same time, bring out
my idea in a clearer light:&mdash;</p>

<p>If the animal propensities are strongly developed,
and not tempered by the intellectual
faculties, the moral conceptions must be exceedingly
low, because they necessarily depend on
the clearness, refinement, and comprehensiveness
of the ideas derived from the material world
through the senses. The religious cravings will,
therefore, be contented with a gross worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
material objects, and the moral sense degenerate
into a grovelling superstition. The utmost elevation
which a population, so constituted, can reach,
will be an unconscious impersonation of the good
aspirations and the evil tendencies of their nature
under the form of a good and an evil spirit, to
the latter of which absurd and often bloody
homage is paid. Government there can be no
other than the right which force gives to the
strong, and its forms will be slavery among themselves,
and submissiveness of all to a tyrannical
absolutism.</p>

<p>When the same animal propensities are combined
with intellect of a higher order, the moral
faculties have more room for action. The penetration
of intellect will not be long in discovering
that the gratification of physical desires is easiest
and safest in a state of order and stability. Hence
a more complex system of legislation both social
and political. The conceptions of the Deity will
be more elevated and refined, though the idea of
a future state will probably be connected with
visions of material enjoyment, as in the paradise
of the Mohammedans.</p>

<p>Where the animal propensities are weak and
the intellect feeble, a vegetating national life results.
No political organization, or of the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
simplest kind. Few laws, for what need of restraining
passions which do not exist. The moral sense
content with the vague recognition of a superior
being, to whom few or no rites are rendered.</p>

<p>But when the animal propensities are so moderate
as to be subordinate to an intellect more or less
vigorous, the moral aspirations will yearn towards
the regions of the abstract. Religion becomes a
system of metaphysics, and often loses itself in the
mazes of its own subtlety. The political organization
and civil legislation will be simple, for
there are few passions to restrain; but the laws
which regulate social intercourse will be many
and various, and supposed to emanate directly
from the Deity.</p>

<p>Strong animal passions, joined to an intellect
equally strong, allow the greatest expanse for the
moral sense. Political organizations the most
complex and varied, social and civil laws the most
studied, will be the outward character of a society
composed of such elements. Internally we shall
perceive the greatest contrasts of individual goodness
and wickedness. Religion will be a symbolism
of human passions and the natural elements
for the many, an ingenious fabric of moral speculations
for the few.</p>

<p>I have here rapidly sketched a series of pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
from nature, which the historian and ethnographer
will not fail to recognize. Whether the features
thus cursorily delineated are owing to the causes
to which I ascribe them, I must leave for the
reader to decide. My space is too limited to
allow of my entering into an elaborate argumentation.
But I would observe that, by taking this
view of the subject, we can understand why all
human&mdash;and therefore false&mdash;religions are so intimately
connected with the social and political
organization of the peoples which profess them,
and why they are so plainly mapped out on the
globe as belonging to certain races, to whom alone
they are applicable, and beyond whose area they
cannot extend: while Christianity knows no political
or social forms, no geographical or ethnological
limits. The former, being the productions
of human intellect, must vary with its variation,
and perish in its decay, while revelation is universal
and immutable, like the Intelligence of which it
is the emanation.</p>

<p>It is time now to conclude the task, the accomplishment
of which has carried me far beyond the
limits I had at first proposed to myself. If I have
so long detained the reader on the threshold of the
edifice, it was to facilitate his after progress, and to
give him a chart, that he may not lose himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the vast field it covers. There he may often meet
me again, and if I be sometimes deemed officious
with my proffered explanations, he will at least
give me credit for good intentions, and he may, if
he chooses, pass me without recognition. Both
this introduction and notes in the body of the
work were thought necessary for several reasons.
First, the subject is in some measure a new one,
and it was important to guard against misconception,
and show, right at the beginning, what was
attempted to be proved, and in what manner. Secondly,
the author wrote for a European public,
and many allusions are made, or positions taken,
upon an assumed knowledge of facts, of which the
general reader on this side of the ocean can be
supposed to have but a slight and vague apprehension.
Thirdly, the author has, in many cases,
contented himself with abstract reasoning, and
therefore is sometimes chargeable with obscureness,
on which account familiar illustrations have
been supplied. Fourthly, the volume now presented
to the reader is one of a series of four, the
remainder of which, if this meets the public approbation,
may in time appear in an English garb.
But it was important to make this, as much as
possible, independent of the others and complete
in itself. The discussion of the moral and intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">[Pg 99]</a></span>diversities of the various groups of the
human family, is, as I have before shown, totally
independent of the question of unity or diversity
of species; yet, as it increases the interest attached
to the solution of that question, which has been
but imperfectly discussed by the author, my esteemed
friend, Dr. J. C. Nott, who has so often and
so ably treated the subject, has promised to furnish,
in notes and an appendix, such additional facts
pertaining to his province as a naturalist, as may
assist the reader in arriving at a correct opinion.</p>

<p>With regard to the translation, it must be observed
that it is not a <em>literal</em> rendering of the original.
The translator has aimed rather at giving
the meaning, than the exact words or phraseology
of the author, at no time, however, departing from
the former. He has, in some instances, condensed
or omitted what seemed irrelevant, or useless to
the discussion of the question in this country, and
in a few cases, he has transposed a sentence to a
different part of the paragraph, where it seemed
more in its place, and more effective. To explain
and justify these alterations, we must remind our
readers that the author wrote for a public essentially
different from that of the translator; that
continental writers on grave subjects are in general
more intent upon vindicating their opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
than the form in which they express them, and
seldom devote that attention to style which English
or American readers expect; to which may be added
that Count Gobineau wrote in the midst of a multiplicity
of diplomatic affairs, and had no time,
even if he had thought it worth his while, to give
his work that literary finish which would satisfy
the fastidious. Had circumstances permitted, this
translation would have been submitted to his approbation,
but at the time of its going to press he
is engaged in the service of his country at the
court of Persia.</p>

<p class="tbreak">For obtruding the present work on the notice
of the American public, no apology will be required.
The subject is one of immense importance,
and especially in this country, where it can
seldom be discussed without adventitious circumstances
biassing the inquirers. To the philanthropist,
the leading idea of the book, "that different
races, like different individuals, are specially fitted
for special purposes, for the fulfilment of which
they are accountable in the measure laid down in
Holy Writ: 'To whom much is given, from him
much will be asked,' and that they are <em>equal</em> only
when they truly and faithfully perform the duties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
their station"&mdash;to the philanthropist, this idea must
be fraught with many valuable suggestions. So
far from loosening the ties of brotherhood, it binds
them closer, because it teaches us not to despise
those who are endowed differently from us; and
shows us that they, too, may have excellencies
which we have not.</p>

<p>To the statesman, the student of history, and
the general reader, it is hoped that this volume
will not be altogether useless, and may assist to a
better understanding of many of the problems that
have so long puzzled the philosopher. The greatest
revolutions in national relations have been accomplished
by the migrations of races, the most
calamitous wars that have desolated the globe have
been the result of the hostility of races. Even
now, a cloud is lowering in the horizon. The
friend of peace and order watches it with silent
anxiety, lest he hasten its coming. The spirit of
mischief exults in its approach, but fears to betray
his plans. Thus, western and central Europe now
present the spectacle of a lull before the storm.
Monarchs sit trembling on their thrones, while
nations mutter curses. Nor have premonitory
symptoms been wanting. Three times, within
little more than half a century, have the eruptions
of that ever-burning political volcano&mdash;France&mdash;shaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">[Pg 102]</a></span>the social and political system of the civilized
world, and shown the amount of combustible
materials, which all the efforts of a ruling class
cannot always protect from ignition. The grand
catastrophe may come within our times. And, is
it the result of any particular social condition, the
action of any particular class in the social scale,
the diffusion of any particular political principles?
No, because the revolutionary tendencies are various,
and even opposite; if republican in one place,
monarchical in another; if democratic in France,
aristocratic in Poland. Nor is it a particular social
class wherein the revolutionary principle flourishes,
for the classes which, in one country, wish subversion,
in another, are firmly attached to the established
order of things. The poor in Germany are
proletarians and revolutionists; in Spain, Portugal,
and Italy, the enthusiastic lovers of their king.
The better classes in the former country are
mostly conservative; in the latter, they are the
makers, or rather attempters, of revolutions. Nor
is it any particular social condition, for no class is
so degraded as it has been; never was poverty less,
and prosperity greater in Europe than in the present
century; and everywhere the political institutions
are more liberal than ever before. Whence,
then, this gathering storm? Does it exist only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the minds of the visionary, or is it a mere bugbear
of the timorous? Ask the prudent statesman, the
traveller who pierces the different strata of the
population; look behind the grates of the State-prisons;
count&mdash;if this be possible&mdash;the number
of victims of military executions in Germany and
Austria, in 1848 and 1849; read the fearful accounts
of the taking of Vienna, of Rome, of Ancona,
of Venice, during the same short space of time.
Everywhere the same cry: Nationality. It is not
the temporary ravings of a mob rendered frantic
by hunger and misery. It is a question of nationality,
a war of races. Happy we who are removed
from the immediate scene of the struggle, and can
be but remotely affected by it. Yet, while I write,
it seems as though the gales of the Atlantic had
blown to our peaceful shores some taints of the
epidemic that rages in the Old World. May it soon
pass over, and a healthy atmosphere again prevail!</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Perishable condition of all human societies&mdash;Ancient ideas concerning
this phenomenon&mdash;Modern theories.</p></div>


<p>The downfall of civilizations is the most striking,
and, at the same time, the most obscure of all the
phenomena of history. If the sublime grandeur
of this spectacle impresses the mind with awe, the
mystery in which it is wrapped presents a boundless
field for inquiry and meditation to a reflecting
mind. The study of the birth and growth of nations
is, indeed, fraught with many valuable observations:
the gradual development of human
societies, their successes, conquests, and triumphs,
strike the imagination in a lively manner, and
excite an ever increasing interest. But these
phenomena, however grand and interesting, seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
susceptible of an easy explanation. We consider
them as the necessary consequences of the intellectual
and moral endowments of man. Once we
admit the existence of these endowments, their
results will no longer surprise us.</p>

<p>But we perceive that, after a period of glory and
strength, all societies formed by man begin to totter
and fall; all, I said, because there is no exception.
Scattered over the surface of our globe, we
see the vestiges of preceding civilizations, many
of which are known to us only by name, or have
not left behind them even that faint memorial, and
are recorded only by the mute stones in the depths
of primeval forests.<a name="FNanchor-30" id="FNanchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> If we glance at our modern
States, we are forced to the conclusion that, though
their date is but of yesterday, some of them already
exhibit signs of old age. The awful truth of prophetic
language about the instability of all things
human, applies with equal force to political bodies
and to individuals, to nations and their civilizations.
Every association of men for social and
political purposes, though protected by the most
ingenious social and political ties and contrivances,
conceals among the very elements of its life, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
germ of inevitable destruction, contracted the day
it was formed. This terrible fact is proved by the
history of all ages as well as of our own. It is
owing to a natural law of death which seems to
govern societies as well as individuals; but, does
this law operate alike in all cases? is it uniform
like the result it brings about, and do all civilizations
perish from the same pre-existing cause?</p>

<p>A superficial glance at the page of history would
tempt us to answer in the negative, for the apparent
causes of the downfall of the great empires of
antiquity were very different in each case. Yet,
if we pierce below the surface, we find in this very
necessity of decay, which weighs so imperiously
upon all societies without exception, the evidence
of the existence of some general, though concealed,
cause, producing a natural death, even where no
external causes anticipate it by violent destruction.
We also discover that all civilizations, after a short
duration, exhibit, to the acute observer, certain
intimate disturbances, difficult to define, but whose
existence is undeniable; and that these present in
all cases an analogous character. Finally, if we
distinguish the ruin of civilizations from that of
States (for we sometimes see the same culture
subsist in a country under foreign domination, and
survive the destruction of the political body which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
gave it birth; while, again, comparatively slight
misfortunes cause it to be transformed, or to disappear
altogether), we become more and more
confirmed in the idea that this principle of death
in all societies is not only a necessary condition of
their life, independent, in a great measure, of external
causes, but is also uniform in all. To fix
and determine this principle, and to trace its effects
in the lives of those nations, of whom history has
left us records, has been my object and endeavor
in the studies, the results of which I now lay before
the reader.</p>

<p>The fact that every human agglomeration, and
the peculiar culture resulting from it, is doomed
to perish, was not known to the ancients. Even
in the epochs immediately preceding ours, it was
not believed. The religious spirit of Asiatic antiquity
looked upon the great political catastrophes
in the same light that they did upon the sudden destruction
of an individual: as a demonstration of
Divine wrath, visiting a nation or an individual
whose sins had marked them out for signal punishment,
which would serve as an example to those criminals
whom the rod had as yet spared. The Jews,
misunderstanding the meaning of the promise,
believed their empire imperishable. Rome, at the
very moment when the threatening clouds lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
in the horizon of her grandeur, entertained no
doubt as to the eternity of hers.<a name="FNanchor-31" id="FNanchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> But our generation
has profited by experience; and, as no one
presumes to doubt that all men must die, because
all who came before us have died; so we are firmly
convinced, that the days of nations, as of individuals,
however many they be, are numbered. The
wisdom of the ancients, therefore, will afford us
but little assistance in the unravelling of our subject,
if we except one fundamental maxim: that
the finger of Divine Providence is always visible
in the conduct of the affairs of this world. From
this solid basis we shall not depart, accepting it in
the full extent that it is recognized by the church.
It cannot be contested that no civilization will
perish without the will of God, and to apply to the
mortal condition of all societies, the sacred axiom
by which the ancients explained certain remarkable,
and, in their opinion, isolated cases of destruction,
is but proclaiming a truth of the first
order, of which we must never lose sight in our
researches after truths of secondary importance.
If it be further added that societies perish by their
sins, I willingly accede to it; it is but drawing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
parallel between them and individuals who also
find their death, or accelerate it, by disobedience
to the laws of the Creator. So far, there is nothing
contradictory to reason, even when unassisted by
Divine light; but these two truths once admitted
and duly weighed, the wisdom of the ancients, I
repeat, affords no further assistance. They did
not search into the ways by which the Divine will
effected the ruin of nations; on the contrary, they
were rather inclined to consider these ways as
essentially mysterious, and above comprehension.
Seized with pious terror at the aspect of the wrecks,
they easily imagined that Providence had specially
interfered thus to strike and completely
destroy once powerful states. Where a miracle
is recorded by the Sacred Scriptures, I willingly
submit; but where that high testimony is wanting,
as it is in the great number of cases, we may justly
consider the ancient theory as defective, and not
sufficiently enlightened. We may even conclude,
that as Divine Justice watches over nations unremittingly,
and its decrees were pronounced ere the
first human society was formed, they are also enforced
in a predeterminate manner, and according
to the unalterable laws of the universe, which
govern both animated nature and the inorganic
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
If we have cause to reproach the philosophers of
the earlier ages, for having contented themselves,
in attempting to fathom the mystery, with the vindication
of an incontestable theological truth, but
which itself is another mystery; at least, they
have not increased the difficulties of the question
by making it a theme for a maze of errors. In
this respect, they rank highly above the rationalist
schools of various epochs.</p>

<p>The thinkers of Athens and Rome established
the doctrine, which has retained its ground to our
days, that states, nations, civilizations, perished
only through luxury, enervation, bad government,
corruption of morals, fanaticism. All these causes,
either singly or combined, were supposed to account
for the downfall of civilizations. It is a
necessary consequence of this doctrine, that where
neither of these causes are in operation, no destructive
agency is at work. Societies would therefore
possess this advantage over individuals, that they
could die no other but a violent death; and, to
establish a body politic as durable as the globe
itself, nothing further would be necessary than to
elude the dangers which I enumerated above.</p>

<p>The inventors of this thesis did not perceive its
bearing. They considered it as an excellent means
for illustrating the doctrine of morality, which, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
is well known, was the sole aim of their historical
writings. In their narratives of events, they were so
strongly preoccupied with showing the happy rewards
of virtue, and the disastrous results of crime
and vice, that they cared little for what seemed to
furnish no illustration. This erroneous and narrow-minded
system often operated contrary to the intention
of the authors, for it applied, according to occasion,
the name of virtue and vice in a very arbitrary
manner; still, to a great extent, the severe
and laudable sentiment upon which it was based,
excuses it. If the genius of a Plutarch or a Tacitus
could draw from history, studied in this manner,
nothing but romances and satires, yet the romances
were sublime, and the satires generous.</p>

<p>I wish I could be equally indulgent to the
writers of the eighteenth century, who made their
own application of the same theory; but there is,
between them and their teachers, too great a difference.
While the ancients were attached to the
established social system, even to a fault, our
moderns were anxious for destruction, and greedy
of untried novelties. The former exerted themselves
to deduce useful lessons from their theory;
the latter have perverted it into a fearful weapon
against all rational principles of government, which
they stigmatized by every term that mankind holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in horror. To save societies from ruin, the disciples
of Voltaire would destroy religion, law, industry,
commerce; because, if we believe them,
religion is fanaticism; laws, despotism; industry
and commerce, luxury and corruption.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest intention of entering
the field of polemics; I wished merely to direct
attention to the widely diverging results of this
principle, when applied by Thucydides, or the
Abb&eacute; Raynal. Conservative in the one, cynically
aggressive in the other, it is erroneous in both.</p>

<p>The causes to which the downfall of nations is
generally ascribed are not the true ones, and
whilst I admit that these evils may be rifest in
the last stages of dissolution of a people, I deny
that they possess in themselves sufficient strength,
and so destructive an energy, as to produce the
final, irremediable catastrophe.</p>

<p>Before entering upon my reasons for the opinion
expressed at the end of the preceding chapter,
it will be necessary to explain and define what I
understand by the term society. I do not apply
this term to the more or less extended circle belonging
to a distinct sovereignty. The republic
of Athens is not, in my sense of the word, a society;
neither is the kingdom of Magadha, the
empire of Pontus, or the caliphat of Egypt in the
time of the Fatimites. These are fragments of
societies, which are transformed, united, or subdivided,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115">[Pg 115]</a></span>by the operation of those primordial laws
into which I am inquiring, but whose existence or
annihilation does not constitute the existence or
annihilation of a society. Their formation is, for
the most part, a transient phenomenon, which exerts
but a limited, or even indirect influence upon the
civilization that gave it birth. By the term society,
I understand an association of men, actuated
by similar ideas, and possessed of the same general
instincts. This association need by no means
be perfect in a political sense, but must be complete
from a social point of view. Thus, Egypt,
Assyria, Greece, India, China, have been, or are
still, the theatres upon which distinct societies
have worked out their destinies, to which the perturbations
in their political relations were merely
secondary. I shall, therefore, speak of the fractions
of these societies only when my reasoning
applies equally to the whole. I am now prepared
to proceed to the examination of the question before
us, and I hope to prove that fanaticism, luxury,
corruption of morals, and irreligion, do not <em>necessarily</em>
occasion the ruin of nations.</p>

<p>All these maladies, either singly or combined,
have attacked, and sometimes with great virulence,
nations which nevertheless recovered from them,
and were, perhaps, all the more vigorous afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
The Aztec empire, in Mexico, seemed to flourish
for the especial glory and exaltation of fanaticism.
What can there be more fanatical than a social
and political system, based on a religion which
requires the incessant and profuse shedding of the
blood of fellow-beings?<a name="FNanchor-32" id="FNanchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> Our remote ancestors,
the barbarous nations of Northern Europe, did
indeed practise this unholy rite, but they never
chose for their sacrifices innocent victims,<a name="FNanchor-33" id="FNanchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> or, at
least, such as they considered so: the shipwrecked
and prisoners of war, were not considered innocent.
But, for the Mexicans, all victims were alike; with
that ferocity, which a modern physiologist<a name="FNanchor-34" id="FNanchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> recognizes
as a characteristic of the races of the New
World, they butchered their own fellow-citizens
indiscriminately, and without remorse or pity. And
yet, this did not prevent them from being a powerful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">[Pg 117]</a></span>industrious, and wealthy nation, who might
long have continued to blaspheme the Deity by
their dark creed, but for Cortez's genius and
the bravery of his companions. In this instance,
then, fanaticism was not the cause of the downfall.<a name="FNanchor-35" id="FNanchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Nor are luxury or enervation more powerful in
their effects. These vices are almost always peculiar
<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden;"><a name="page119" id="page119">[Pg 119]</a></span>to the higher classes, and seldom penetrate
the whole mass of the population. But I doubt
whether among the Greeks, the Persians, or the
Romans, whose downfall they are said to have
caused, luxury and enervation, albeit in a different
form, had risen to a higher pitch than we see them
to-day in some of our modern States, in France,
Germany, England, and Russia, for instance. The
two last countries are especially distinguished for
the luxury prevalent among the higher classes,
and yet, these two countries seem to be endued
with a vitality much more vigorous and promising
than most other European States. In the Middle
Ages, the Venetians, Genoese, Pisanese, accumulated
in their magazines the treasures and luxuries
of the world; yet, the gorgeous magnificence of
their palaces, and the splendid decorations of their
vessels, did certainly not diminish their power, or
subvert their dominion.<a name="FNanchor-36" id="FNanchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Even the corruption of morals, this most terrible
of all scourges, is not necessarily a cause of
national ruin. If it were, the prosperity of a nation,
its power and preponderance, would be in a
direct ratio to the purity of its manners; and it is
hardly necessary to say that this is not the case.
The odd fashion of ascribing all sorts of imaginary
virtues to the first Romans, is now pretty much
out of date.<a name="FNanchor-37" id="FNanchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> Few would now dare to hold up as
models of morality those sturdy patricians of the
old school, who treated their women as slaves, their
children as cattle, and their creditors like wild
beasts. If there should still be some who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
defend so bad a cause, their reasoning could easily
be refuted, and its want of solidity shown. Abuse
of power, in all epochs, has created equal indignation;
there were deeper reasons for the abolition of
royalty than the rape of Lucretia, for the expulsion
of the decemvirs than the outrage of Appius; but
these pretexts for two important revolutions, sufficiently
demonstrate the public sentiment with regard
to morals. It is a great mistake to ascribe the vigor
of a young nation to its superior virtues; since
the beginning of historical times, there has not
been a community, however small, among which
all the reprehensible tendencies of human nature
were not visible, notwithstanding which, it has increased
and prospered. There are even instances
where the splendor of a state was owing to the
most abominable institutions. The Spartans are
indebted for their renown, and place in history, to
a legislation fit only for a community of bandits.<a name="FNanchor-38" id="FNanchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122">[Pg 122]</a></span>So far from being willing to accord to youthful
communities any superiority in regard to morals,
<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden;"><a name="page123" id="page123">[Pg 123]</a></span>I have no doubt that, as nations advance in age
and consequently approach their period of decay,
they present to the eyes of the moralist a far more
satisfactory spectacle.<a name="FNanchor-39" id="FNanchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> Manners become milder;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124">[Pg 124]</a></span>men accommodate themselves more readily to one
another; the means of subsistence become, if not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125">[Pg 125]</a></span>easier, at least more varied; reciprocal obligations
are better defined and understood; more refined
theories of right and wrong gain ground. It would
be difficult to show that at the time when the
Greek arms conquered Darius, or when Greek
liberty itself fled forever from the battle-field of
Ch&aelig;ron&aelig;a, or when the Goths entered Rome as
victors; that the Persian monarchy, Athens, or
the imperial city, in those times of their downfall,
contained a smaller proportion of honest and virtuous
people than in the most glorious epochs of
their national existence.</p>

<p>But we need not go so far back for illustrations.
If any one were required to name
the place where the spirit of our age displayed
itself in the most complete contrast with the
virtuous ages of the world (if such there were),
he would most certainly point out Paris. Yet,
many learned and pious persons have assured
me, that nowhere, and in no epoch, could more
practical virtue, solid piety, greater delicacy of
conscience, be found than within the precincts of
this great and corrupt city. The ideal of goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
is as exalted, the duties of a Christian as well understood,
as by the most brilliant luminaries of
the Church in the seventeenth century. I might
add, that these virtues are divested of the bitterness
and severity from which, in those times, they were
not always exempt; and that they are more united
with feelings of toleration and universal philanthropy.<a name="FNanchor-40" id="FNanchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a>
Thus we find, as if to counterbalance
the fearful aberrations of our own epoch, in the
principal theatre of these aberrations, contrasts
more numerous and more striking, than probably
blessed the sight of the faithful in preceding ages.</p>

<p>I cannot even perceive that great men are wanting
in those periods of corruption and decay; on
the contrary, these periods are often signalized by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the appearance of men remarkable for energy of
character and stern virtue.<a name="FNanchor-41" id="FNanchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> If we look at the
catalogue of Roman emperors, we find a great
number of them as exalted in merit as in rank;
we meet with names like those of Trajan, Antoninus
Pius, Septimius Severus, Alexander Severus,
Jovian; and if we glance beneath the throne,
we see a glorious constellation of great doctors
of our faith, of martyrs, and apostles of the primitive
church; not to consider the number of
virtuous pagans. Active, firm, and valorous minds
filled the camps and the forums, so that it may
reasonably be doubted whether Rome, in the times
of Cincinnatus, possessed so great a number of
eminent men in every department of human activity.
Many other examples might be alleged, to
prove that senile and tottering communities, so
far from being deficient in men of virtue, talent,
and action, possess them probably in greater number
than young and rising states; and that their
general standard of morals is often higher.</p>

<p>Public morality, indeed, varies greatly at different
periods of a nation's history. The history of
the French nation, better than any other, illustrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
this fact. Few will deny that the Gallo-Romans
of the fifth and sixth centuries, though a subject
race, were greatly superior in point of morals
to their heroic conquerors.<a name="FNanchor-42" id="FNanchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> Individually taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
they were often not inferior to the latter in courage
and military virtue.<a name="FNanchor-43" id="FNanchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> The intermixture of the
two races, during the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries,
reduced the standard of morals among the
whole nation to a disgraceful level. In the three
succeeding centuries, the picture brightens again.
Yet, this period of comparative light was succeeded
by the dark scenes of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, when tyranny and debauchery
ran riot over the land, and infected all classes of
society, not excepting the clergy; when the nobles
robbed their vassals, and the commonalty sold their
country to a foreign foe. This period, so distinguished
for the total absence of patriotism, and
every honest sentiment, was emphatically one of
decay; the state was shaken to its very foundation,
and seemed ready to bury under its ruins so much
shame and dishonor. But the crisis passed; foreign
and intestine foes were vanquished; the machinery
of government reconstructed on a firmer basis;
the state of society improved. Notwithstanding
its bloody follies, the sixteenth century dishonors
less the annals of the nation than its predecessors,
and it formed the transition period to the age of
those pure and ever-brilliant lights, Fenelon, Bossuet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Montausier, and others. This period, again,
was succeeded by the vices of the regency, and the
horrors of the Revolution. Since that time, we
have witnessed almost incredible fluctuations of
public morality every decade of years.</p>

<p>I have sketched rapidly, and merely pointed
out the most prominent changes. To do even
this properly, much more to descend to details,
would require greater space than the limits and
designs of this work permit. But I think what
I have said is sufficient to show that the corruption
of public morals, though always a great,
is often a transient evil, a malady which may be
corrected or which corrects itself, and cannot,
therefore, be the sole cause of national ruin,
though it may hasten the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The corruption of public morals is nearly allied
to another evil, which has been assigned as one of
the causes of the downfall of empires. It is observed
of Athens and Rome, that the glory of
these two commonwealths faded about the same
time that they abandoned their national creeds.
These, however, are the only examples of such a
coincidence that can be cited. The religion of
Zoroaster was never more flourishing in the Persian
empire, than at the time of its downfall.
Tyre, Carthage, Judea, the Mexican and Peruvian<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
empires expired at the moment when they embraced
their altars with the greatest zeal and
devotion. Nay, I do not believe that even at
Athens and Rome, the ancient creed was abandoned
until the day when it was replaced in every
conscience, by the complete triumph of Christianity.
I am firmly convinced that, politically
speaking, irreligion never existed among any
people, and that none ever abandoned the faith of
their forefathers, except in exchange for another.
In other words, there never was such a thing as a
religious interregnum. The Gallic Teutates gave
way to the Jupiter of the Romans; the worship of
Jupiter, in its turn, was replaced by Christianity.
It is true that, in Athens, not long before the time
of Pericles, and in Rome, towards the age of the
Scipios, it became the fashion among the higher
classes, first to reason upon religious subjects,
next to doubt them, and finally to disbelieve them
altogether, and to pride themselves upon scepticism.
But though there were many who joined
in the sentiment of the ancient "freethinker" who
dared the augurs to look at one another without
laughing, yet this scepticism never gained ground
among the mass of the people.</p>

<p>Aspasia at her evening parties, and Lelius
among his intimates, might ridicule the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
dogmas of their country, and amuse themselves at
the expense of those that believed them. But at
both these epochs, the most brilliant in the history
of Greece and Rome, it would have been highly
dangerous to express such sentiments publicly.
The imprudence of his mistress came near costing
Pericles himself dearly, and the tears which he
shed before the tribunal, were not in themselves
sufficiently powerful to save the fair sceptic. The
poets of the times, Aristophanes, Sophocles, and
afterwards &AElig;schylus, found it necessary, whatever
were their private sentiments, to flatter the religious
notions of the masses. The whole nation
regarded Socrates as an impious innovator, and
would have put to death Anaxagoras, but for the
strenuous intercession of Pericles. Nor did the
philosophical and sceptical theories penetrate the
masses at a later period. Never, at any time, did
they extend beyond the sphere of the elegant and
refined. It may be objected that the opinion of
the rest, the mechanics, traders, the rural population,
the slaves, etc., was of little moment, as
they had no influence in the policy of the state.
If this were the case, why was it necessary, until
the last expiring throb of Paganism, to preserve
its temples and pay the hierophants? Why did
men, the most eminent and enlightened, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
sceptical in their religious notions, not only don
the sacerdotal robe, but even descend to the most
repugnant offices of the popular worship? The
daily reader of Lucretius<a name="FNanchor-44" id="FNanchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> had to snatch moments
of leisure from the all-absorbing game of politics,
to compose a treatise on haruspicy. I allude to
the first C&aelig;sar.<a name="FNanchor-45" id="FNanchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> And all his successors, down to
Constantine, were compelled to unite the pontificial
with the imperial dignity. Even Constantine
himself, though as a Christian prince he had far
better reasons for repugnance to such an office<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
than any of his predecessors, was compelled
to compromise with the still powerful ancient
religion of the nation.<a name="FNanchor-46" id="FNanchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> This is a clear proof
of the prevalence of the popular sentiment
over the opinion of the higher and more enlightened
classes. They might appeal to reason
and common sense, against the absurdities of the
masses, but the latter would not, could not, renounce
one faith until they had adopted another,
confirming the old truth, that in the affairs of this
world, the positive ever takes precedent over the
negative. The popular sentiment was so strong
that, in the third century, it infected even the
higher classes to some extent, and created among
them a serious religious reaction, which did not
entirely subside until after the final triumph of
Christianity. The revolution of ideas which gradually
diffused true religion among all classes, is
highly interesting, and it may not be altogether
irrelevant to my subject, to point out the principal
causes which occasioned it.</p>

<p>In the latter stages of the Roman empire, the
armies had acquired such undue political preponderance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135">[Pg 135]</a></span>that from the emperor, who inevitably
was chosen by them, down to the pettiest governor
of a district, all the functionaries of the government
issued from the ranks. They had sprung
from those popular masses, of whose passionate
attachment to their faith I have already spoken,
and upon attaining their elevated stations, came
in contact with the former rulers of the country,
the old distinguished families, the municipal dignitaries
of cities, in fact those classes who took
pride and delight in sceptical literature. At first
there was hostility between these latter and the
real rulers of the state, whom they would willingly
have treated as upstarts, if they had dared. But
as the court gave the tone, and all the minor military
chiefs were, for the most part, devout and
fanatic, the sceptics were compelled to disguise
their real sentiments, and the philosophers set
about inventing systems to reconcile the rationalistic
theories with the state religion. This revival
of pagan piety caused the greater number of the
persecutions. The rural populations, who had
suffered their faith to be outraged by the atheists
so long as the higher classes domineered over
them, now, that the imperial democracy had reduced
all to the same level, were panting for
revenge; but, mistaking their victims, they directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
their fury against the Christians. The real sceptics
were such men as King Agrippa, who wishes
to hear St. Paul<a name="FNanchor-47" id="FNanchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> from mere curiosity; who hears
him, debates with him, considers him a fool, but
never thinks of persecuting him because he differs
in opinion; or Tacitus, the historian, who, though
full of contempt for the believers in the new
religion, blames Nero for his cruelties towards
them.</p>

<p>Agrippa and Tacitus were pagan sceptics. Diocletian
was a politician, who gave way to the
clamors of an incensed populace. Decius and
Aurelian were fanatics, like the masses they
governed, and from whom they had sprung.</p>

<p>Even after the Christian religion had become
the religion of the state, what immense difficulties
were experienced in attempting to bring the masses
within its pale! So hopeless was in some places
the contest with the local divinities, that in many
instances conversion was rather the result of address,
than the effect of persuasion. The genius
of the holy propagators of our religion was reduced
to the invention of pious frauds. The
divinities of the groves, fields, and fountains, were
still worshipped, but under the name of the saints,
the martyrs, and the Virgin. After being for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
time misdirected, these homages would finally
find the right way. Yet such is the obstinacy
with which the masses cling to a faith once received,
that there are traces of it remaining in our
day. There are still parishes in France, where
some heathenish superstition alarms the piety, and
defies the efforts of the minister. In Catholic Brittany,
even in the last centuries, the bishop in vain
attempted to dehort his flock from the worship of
an idol of stone. The rude image was thrown
into the water, but rescued by its obstinate adorers;
and the assistance of the military was required to
break it to pieces. Such was, and such is the
longevity of paganism. I conclude, therefore, that
no nation, either in ancient or modern times, ever
abandoned its religion without having duly and
earnestly embraced another, and that, consequently,
none ever found itself, for a moment, in a state
of irreligion, which could have been the cause of
its ruin.</p>

<p>Having denied the destructive effects of fanaticism,
luxury, and immorality, and the political
possibility of irreligion, I shall now speak of the
effects of bad government. This subject is well
worthy of an entire chapter.</p>

<p class="center">INFLUENCE OF GOVERNMENT UPON THE LONGEVITY
OF NATIONS.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Misgovernment defined&mdash;Athens, China, Spain, Germany, Italy,
etc.&mdash;Is not in itself a sufficient cause for the ruin of nations.</p></div>


<p>I am aware of the difficulty of the task I have
undertaken in attempting to establish a truth,
which by many of my readers will be regarded as
a mere paradox. That good laws and good
government exert a direct and powerful influence
upon the well-being and prosperity of
a nation, is an indisputable fact, of which I am
fully convinced; but I think that history proves
that they are not absolute conditions of the existence
of a community; or, in other words, that
their absence is not necessarily productive of ruin.
Nations, like individuals, are often preyed upon
by fearful diseases, which show no outward traces
of the ravages within, and which, though dangerous,
are not always fatal. Indeed, if they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
few communities would survive the first few years
of their formation, for it is precisely during that
period that the government is worst, the laws most
imperfect, and least observed. But here the comparison
between the body political and the human
organization ceases, for while the latter dreads
most the attack of disease during infancy, the
former easily overcomes it at that period. History
furnishes innumerable examples of successful contest
on the part of young communities with the
most formidable and most devastating political
evils, of which none can be worse than ill-conceived
laws, administered in an oppressive or
negligent manner.<a name="FNanchor-48" id="FNanchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a></p>

<p>Let us first define what we understand by bad
government. The varieties of this evil are as
various as nations, countries, and epochs. It were
impossible to enumerate them all. Yet, by classing
them under four principal categories, few
varieties will be omitted.</p>

<p>A government is bad, when imposed by foreign
influence. Athens experienced this evil under the
thirty tyrants. Yet she shook off the odious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
yoke, and patriotism, far from expiring, gained
renewed vigor by the oppression.</p>

<p>A government is bad, when based upon absolute
and unconditional conquest. Almost the whole extent
of France in the fourteenth century, groaned
under the dominion of England. The ordeal was
passed, and the nation rose from it more powerful
and brilliant than before. China was overrun and
conquered by the Mongol hordes. They were
ejected from its territories, after having previously
undergone a singular transformation. It next fell
into the hands of the Mantchoo conquerors, but
though they already count the years of their reign
by centuries, they are now at the eve of experiencing
the same fate as their Mongol predecessors.</p>

<p>A government is especially bad, when the principles
upon which it was based are disregarded or
forgotten. This was the fate of the Spanish monarchy.
It was based upon the military spirit of
the nation, and upon its municipal freedom, and
declined soon after these principles came to be
forgotten. It is impossible to imagine greater
political disorganization than this country represented.
Nowhere was the authority of the sovereign
more nominal and despised; nowhere did
the clergy lay themselves more open to censure.
Agriculture and industry, following the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
downward impulse, were also involved in the
national marasmus. Yet Spain, of whom so many
despaired, at a moment when her star seemed
setting forever, gave the glorious example of
heroic and successful resistance to the arms of one
who had hitherto experienced no check in his
career of conquest. Since that, the better spirit
of the nation has been roused, and there is, probably,
at this time, no European state with more
promising prospects, and stronger vitality.<a name="FNanchor-49" id="FNanchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
A government is also very bad, when, by its
institutions, it authorizes an antagonism either
between the supreme power and the nation, or
among the different classes of which it is composed.
This was the case in the Middle Ages,
when the kings of France and England were at
war with their great vassals, and the peasants in
perpetual feud with the lords. In Germany, the
first effects of the liberty of thought, were the
civil wars of the Hussites, Anabaptists, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
sectaries. Italy, at a more remote period, was so
distracted by the division of the supreme authority
for which emperor, pope, nobles, and municipalities
contended, that the masses, not knowing whom
to obey, in many instances finished by obeying
neither. Yet in the midst of all these troubles,
Italian nationality did not perish. On the contrary,
its civilization was at no time more brilliant,
its industry never more productive, its foreign influence
never greater.</p>

<p>If communities have survived such fearful political
tempests, it cannot well be said that national
ruin is a necessary cause of misgovernment. Besides,
wise and happy reigns are few and far
between, in the history of every nation; and these
few are not considered such by all. Historians
are not unanimous in their praise of Elizabeth,
nor do they all consider the reign of William and
Mary as an epoch of prosperity for England.
Truly this science of statesmanship, the highest
and most complicated of all, is so disproportionate
to the capacity of man,<a name="FNanchor-50" id="FNanchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> and so various are the
opinions concerning it, that nations have early and
frequent opportunities of learning to accommodate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144">[Pg 144]</a></span>themselves to misgovernment, which, in its
worst forms, is still preferable to anarchy. It is a
well-proved fact, which even a superficial study of
history will clearly demonstrate, that communities
often perish under the best government of a long
series that came before.<a name="FNanchor-51" id="FNanchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a></p>

<p class="center">DEFINITION OF THE WORD DEGENERACY&mdash;ITS
CAUSE.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Skeleton history of a nation&mdash;Origin of castes, nobility, etc.&mdash;Vitality
of nations not necessarily extinguished by conquest&mdash;China,

<p>If the spirit of the preceding pages has been at
all understood, it will be seen that I am far from
considering these great national maladies, misgovernment,
fanaticism, irreligion, and immorality,
as mere trifling accidents, without influence or importance.
On the contrary, I sincerely pity the
community which is afflicted by such scourges,
and think that no efforts can be misdirected which
tend to mitigate or remove them. But I repeat,
that unless these disorganizing elements are grafted
upon another more destructive principle, unless
they are the consequences of a greater, though
concealed, evil; we may rest assured that their
ravages are not fatal, and that society, after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
shorter or longer period of suffering, will escape
their toils, perhaps with renewed vigor and youth.</p>

<p>The examples I have alleged seem to me conclusive;
their number, if necessary, might be increased
to any extent. But the conviction has
already gained ground, that these are but secondary
evils, to which an undue importance has
hitherto been attached, and that the law which
governs the life and death of societies must be
sought for elsewhere, and deeper. It is admitted
that the germ of destruction is inherent in the
constitution of communities; that so long as it
remains latent, exterior dangers are little to be
dreaded; but when it has once attained full growth
and maturity, the nation must die, even though
surrounded by the most favorable circumstances,
precisely as a jaded steed breaks down, be the
track ever so smooth.</p>

<p>Degeneracy was the name given to this cause of
dissolution. This view of the question was a great
step towards the truth, but, unfortunately, it went
no further; the first difficulty proved insurmountable.
The term was certainly correct, etymologically
and in every other respect, but how is it with
the definition. A people is said to be degenerated,
when it is badly governed, abuses its riches, is
fanatical, or irreligious; in short, when it has lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the characteristic virtues of its forefathers. This
is begging the question. Thus, communities succumb
under the burden of social and political evils
only when they are degenerate, and they are degenerate
only when such evils prevail. This circular
argument proves nothing but the small
progress hitherto made in the science of national
biology. I readily admit that nations perish from
degeneracy, and from no other cause; it is when
in that wretched condition, that foreign attacks are
fatal to them, for then they no longer possess the
strength to protect themselves against adverse
fortune, or to recover from its blows. They die,
because, though exposed to the same perils as their
ancestors, they have not the same powers of overcoming
them. I repeat it, the term <em>degeneracy</em> is
correct; but it is necessary to define it, to give it
a real and tangible meaning. It is necessary to
say how and why this vigor, this capacity of overcoming
surrounding dangers, are lost. Hitherto,
we have been satisfied with a mere word, but the
thing itself is as little known as ever.<a name="FNanchor-52" id="FNanchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> The step
beyond, I shall attempt to make.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>In my opinion, a nation is degenerate, when
the blood of its founders no longer flows in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
veins, but has been gradually deteriorated by
successive foreign admixtures; so that the nation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
while retaining its original name, is no longer
composed of the same elements. The attenuation<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden;"><a name="page152" id="page152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of the original blood is attended by a modification
of the original instincts, or modes of thinking;
the new elements assert their influence, and when
they have once gained perfect and entire preponderance,
the degeneration may be considered as
complete. With the last remnant of the original
ethnical principle, expires the life of the society
and its civilization. The masses, which composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
it, have thenceforth no separate, independent, social
and political existence; they are attracted to
different centres of civilization, and swell the ranks
of new societies having new instincts and new
purposes.</p>

<p>In attempting to establish this theorem, I am
met by a question which involves the solution of
a far more difficult problem than any I have yet
approached. This question, so momentous in its
bearings, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Is there, in reality, a serious and palpable difference
in the capacity and intrinsic worth of different
branches of the human family?</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness, I shall advance, <i>&agrave; priori</i>,
that this difference exists. It then remains to show
how the ethnical character of a nation can undergo
such a total change as I designate by the term
<em>degeneracy</em>.</p>

<p>Physiologists assert that the human frame is
subject to a constant wear and tear, which would
soon destroy the whole machine, but for new particles
which are continually taking the form and
place of the old ones. So rapid is this change
said to be, that, in a few years, the whole framework
is renovated, and the material identity of the
individual changed. The same, to a great extent,
may be said of nations, only that, while the individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154">[Pg 154]</a></span>always preserves a certain similarity of form
and features, those of a nation are subject to innumerable
and ever-varying changes. Let us take
a nation at the moment when it assumes a political
existence, and commences to play a part in the
great drama of the world's stage. In its embryo,
we call it a tribe.</p>

<p>The simplest and most natural political institution
is that of tribes. It is the only form of
government known to rude and savage nations.
Civilization is the result of a great concentration
of powerful physical and intellectual forces,<a name="FNanchor-53" id="FNanchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a>
which, in small and scattered fragments, is impossible.
The first step towards it is, therefore, undoubtedly,
the union of several tribes by alliance
or conquest. Such a coalescence is what we call
a nation or empire. I think it admits of an easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
demonstration, that in proportion as a human
family is endowed with the capacity for intellectual
progress, it exhibits a tendency to enlarge the
circle of its influence and dominion. On the contrary,
where that capacity is weak, or wanting, we
find the population subdivided into innumerable
small fragments, which, though in perpetual collision,
remain forever detached and isolated. The
stronger may massacre the weaker, but permanent
conquest is never attempted; depredatory incursions
are the sole object and whole extent of warfare.
This is the case with the natives of Polynesia,
many parts of Africa, and the Arctic regions.
Nor can their stagnant condition be ascribed to
local or climatical causes. We have seen such
wretched hordes inhabiting, indifferently, temperate
as well as torrid or frigid zones; fertile prairies
and barren deserts; river-shores and coasts as well
as inland regions. It must therefore be founded
upon an inherent incapacity of progress. The
more civilizable a race is, the stronger is the tendency
for aggregation of masses. Complex political
organizations are not so much the effect as the
cause of civilization.<a name="FNanchor-54" id="FNanchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> A tribe with superior intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156">[Pg 156]</a></span>and physical endowments, soon perceives
that, to increase its power and prosperity, it must
compel its neighbors to enter into the sphere of its
influence. Where peaceful means fail, war is resorted
to. Territories are conquered, a division
into classes established between the victorious and
the subjugated race; in one word, a nation has
made its appearance upon the theatre of history.
The impulse being once given, it will not stop
short in the career of conquest. If wisdom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
moderation preside in its councils, the tracks of
its armies will not be marked by wanton destruction
and bloodshed; the monuments, institutions,
and manners of the conquered will be respected;
superior creations will take the place of the old,
where changes are necessary and useful;&mdash;a great
empire will be formed.<a name="FNanchor-55" id="FNanchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> At first, and perhaps for
a long time, victors and vanquished will remain
separated and distinct. But gradually, as the
pride of the conqueror becomes less obtrusive, and
the bitterness of defeat is forgotten by the conquered;
as the ties of common interest become
stronger, the boundary line between them is obliterated.
Policy, fear, or natural justice, prompts
the masters to concessions; intermarriages take
place, and, in the course of time, the various ethnical
elements are blended, and the different nations
composing the state begin to consider themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
as one. This is the general history of the rise of
all empires whose records have been transmitted
to us.<a name="FNanchor-56" id="FNanchor-56"></a><a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> An inferior race, by falling into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of vigorous masters, is thus called to share a
destiny, of which, alone, it would have been incapable.
Witness the Saxons by the Norman
conquest.<a name="FNanchor-57" id="FNanchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> But, if there is a decided disparity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the capacity of the two races, their mixture, while
it ennobles the baser, deteriorates the nobler; a
new race springs up, inferior to the one, though
superior to the other, and, perhaps, possessed of
peculiar qualities unknown to either. The modification
of the ethnical character of the nation,
however, does not terminate here.</p>

<p>Every new acquisition of territory, by conquest
or treaty, brings an addition of foreign blood. The
wealth and splendor of a great empire attract
crowds of strangers to its capital, great inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
cities, or seaports. Apart from the fact that the
conquering race&mdash;that which founds the empire,
and supports and animates it&mdash;is, in most cases,
inferior in numbers to the masses which it subdued
and assimilated; the conspicuous part which it
takes in the affairs of the state, renders it more
directly exposed to the fatal results of battles,
proscriptions, and revolts.<a name="FNanchor-58" id="FNanchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> In some instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
also, it happens that the substratum of native
populations are singularly prolific&mdash;witness the
Celts and Sclaves. Sooner or later, therefore, the
conquering race is absorbed by the masses which
its vigor and superiority have aggregated. The
very materials of which it erected its splendor, and
upon which it based its strength, are ultimately
the means of its weakness and destruction. But
the civilization which it has developed, may survive
for a limited period. The forward impulse,
once imparted to the mass, will still propel it for a
while, but its force is continually decreasing. Manners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163">[Pg 163]</a></span>laws, and institutions remain, but the spirit
which animated them has fled; the lifeless body
still exhibits the apparent symptoms of life, and,
perhaps, even increases, but the real strength has
departed; the edifice soon begins to totter, at the
slightest collision it will crumble, and bury beneath
its ruins the civilization which it had developed.</p>

<p>If this definition of degeneracy be accepted, and
its consequences admitted, the problem of the rise
and fall of empires no longer presents any difficulty.
A nation lives so long as it preserves the ethnical
principle to which it owes its existence; with this
principle, it loses the <i>primum mobile</i> of its successes,
its glory, and its civilization: it must therefore disappear
from the stage of history. Who can doubt
that if Alexander had been opposed by real Persians,
the men of the Arian stock, whom Cyrus led
to victory, the issue of the battle of Arbela would
have been very different. Or if Rome, in her decadence,
had possessed soldiers and senators like those
of the time of Fabius, Scipio, and Cato, would she
have fallen so easy a prey to the barbarians of the
North?</p>

<p>It will be objected that, even had the integrity
of the original blood remained intact, a time must
have come when they would find their masters.
They would have succumbed under a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
well-combined attacks, a long-continued overwhelming
pressure, or simply by the chances of a
lost battle. The political edifice might have been
destroyed in this manner, not the civilization,
not the social organization. Invasion and defeat
would have been reverses, sad ones, indeed, but
not irremediable. There is no want of facts to
confirm this assertion.</p>

<p>In modern times, the Chinese have suffered two
complete conquests. In each case they have imposed
their manners and their institutions upon
the conquerors; they have given them much, and
received but little in return. The first invaders,
after having undergone this change, were expelled;
the same fate is now threatening the second.<a name="FNanchor-59" id="FNanchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a>
In<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page165" id="page165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
this case the vanquished were intellectually and
numerically superior to their victors. I shall mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166">[Pg 166]</a></span>another case where the victors, though intellectually
superior, are not possessed of sufficient
numerical strength to transform the intellectual
and moral character of the vanquished.</p>

<p>The political supremacy of the British in Hindostan
is perfect, yet they exert little or no moral
influence over the masses they govern. All
that the utmost exertion of their power can effect
upon the fears of their subjects, is an outward
compliance. The notions of the Hindoo cannot
be replaced by European ideas&mdash;the spirit of
Hindoo civilization cannot be conquered by any
power, however great, of the law. Political forms
may change, and do change, without materially
affecting the basis upon which they rest; Hyderabad,
Lahore, and Delhi may cease to be capitals:
Hindoo society will subsist, nevertheless. A time
must come, sooner or later, when India will regain
a separate political existence, and publicly proclaim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167">[Pg 167]</a></span>those laws of her own, which she now
secretly obeys, or of which she is tacitly left in
possession.</p>

<p>The mere accident of conquest cannot destroy
the principle of vitality in a people. At most, it
may suspend for a time the exterior manifestations
of that vitality, and strip it of its outward honors.
But so long as the blood, and consequently the
culture of a nation, exhibit sufficiently strong
traces of the initiatory race, that nation exists;
and whether it has to deal, like the Chinese, with
conquerors who are superior only materially; or
whether, like the Hindoos, it maintains a struggle
of patience against a race much superior in every
respect; that nation may rest assured of its future&mdash;independence
will dawn for it one day. On the
contrary, when a nation has completely exhausted
the initiatory ethnical element, defeat is certain
death; it has consumed the term of existence
which Heaven had granted it&mdash;its destiny is
fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor-60" id="FNanchor-60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
I, therefore, consider the question as settled,
which has been so often discussed, as to what<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden;"><a name="page169" id="page169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
would have been the result, if the Carthaginians,
instead of succumbing to the fortune of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
had conquered Italy. As they belonged to the
Phenician family, a stock greatly inferior to the
Italian in political capacity, they would have been
absorbed by the superior race after the victory,
precisely as they were after the defeat. The final
result, therefore, would have been the same in
either case.</p>

<p>The destiny of civilizations is not ruled by
accident; it depends not on the issue of a battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
a thrust of a sword, the favors or frowns of fickle
fortune. The most warlike, formidable, and triumphant
nations, when they were distinguished
for nothing but bravery, strategical science, and
military successes, have never had a nobler fate
than that of learning from their subjects, perhaps
too late, the art of living in peace. The Celts,
the nomad hordes of Central Asia, are memorable
illustrations of this truth.</p>

<p>The whole of my demonstration now rests upon
one hypothesis, the proof of which I have reserved
for the succeeding chapters: <strong class="smcap">the moral
and intellectual diversities of the various
branches of the human family</strong>.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="center">THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DIVERSITY OF
RACES IS NOT THE RESULT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.</p>

<p class="chapdesc">Antipathy of races&mdash;Results of their mixture&mdash;The scientific
axiom of the absolute equality of men, but an extension of
the political&mdash;Its fallacy&mdash;Universal belief in unequal endowment
of races&mdash;The moral and intellectual diversity of races

France&mdash;Roman Empire&mdash;European Colonies&mdash;Sandwich
Islands&mdash;St. Domingo&mdash;Jesuit missions in Paraguay.</p>


<p>The idea of an innate and permanent difference
in the moral and mental endowments of the various
groups of the human species, is one of the
most ancient, as well as universally adopted, opinions.
With few exceptions, and these mostly in
our own times, it has formed the basis of almost
all political theories, and has been the fundamental
maxim of government of every nation, great or
small. The prejudices of country have no other
cause; each nation believes in its own superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
over its neighbors, and very often different parts
of the same nation regard each other with contempt.
There seems to exist an instinctive antipathy
among the different races, and even among
the subdivisions of the same race, of which none
is entirely exempt, but which acts with the greatest
force in the least civilized or least civilizable.
We behold it in the characteristic suspiciousness
and hostility of the savage; in the isolation from
foreign influence and intercourse of the Chinese
and Japanese; in the various distinctions founded
upon birth in more civilized communities, such as
castes, orders of nobility and aristocratic privileges.<a name="FNanchor-61" id="FNanchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a>
Not even a common religion can extinguish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174">[Pg 174]</a></span>the hereditary aversion of the Arab<a name="FNanchor-62" id="FNanchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a> to the
Turk, of the Kurd to the Nestorian of Syria; or
the bitter hostility of the Magyar and Sclave, who,
without intermingling, have inhabited the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
country for centuries. But as the different types
lose their purity and become blended, this hostility
of race abates; the maxim of absolute and permanent
inequality is first discussed, then doubted.
A man of mixed race or caste will not be apt to
admit disparity in his double ancestry. The superiority
of particular types, and their consequent
claims to dominion, find fewer advocates. This
dominion is stigmatized as a tyrannical usurpation
of power.<a name="FNanchor-63" id="FNanchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> The mixture of castes gives rise to
the political axiom that all men are equal, and,
therefore, entitled to the same rights. Indeed,
since there are no longer any distinct hereditary
classes, none can justly claim superior merit and
privileges. But this assertion, which is true only
where a complete fusion has taken place, is applied
to the whole human race&mdash;to all present, past, and
future generations. The political axiom of equality
which, like the bag of &AElig;olus, contains so many
tempests, is soon followed by the scientific. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
said&mdash;and the more heterogeneous the ethnical
elements of a nation are, the more extensively the
theory gains ground&mdash;that, "all branches of the
human family are endowed with intellectual capacities
of the same nature, which, though in different
stages of development, are all equally susceptible
of improvement." This is not, perhaps,
the precise language, but certainly the meaning.
Thus, the Huron, by proper culture, might become
the equal of the Englishman and Frenchman.
Why, then, I would ask, did he never, in the
course of centuries, invent the art of printing or
apply the power of steam; why, among the warriors
of his tribe, has there never arisen a C&aelig;sar
or a Charlemagne, among his bards and medicine-men,
a Homer or a Hippocrates?</p>

<p>These questions are generally met by advancing
the influence of climate, local circumstances, etc.
An island, it is said, can never be the theatre of
great social and political developments in the same
measure as a continent; the natives of a southern
clime will not display the energy of those of the
north; seacoasts and large navigable rivers will
promote a civilization which could never have
flourished in an inland region;&mdash;and a great deal
more to the same purpose. But all these ingenious
and plausible hypotheses are contradicted by facts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
The same soil and the same climate have been
visited, alternately, by barbarism and civilization.
The degraded fellah is charred by the same sun
which once burnt the powerful priest of Memphis;
the learned professor of Berlin lectures
under the same inclement sky that witnessed the
miseries of the savage Finn.</p>

<p>What is most curious is, that while the belief of
equality may influence institutions and manners,
there is not a nation, nor an individual but renders
homage to the contrary sentiment. Who has not
heard of the distinctive traits of the Frenchman,
the German, the Spaniard, the English, the Russ.
One is called sprightly and volatile, but brave;
the other is sober and meditative; a third is noted
for his gravity; a fourth is known by his coldness
and reserve, and his eagerness of gain; a fifth, on
the contrary, is notorious for reckless expense. I
shall not express any opinion upon the accuracy
of these distinctions, I merely point out that they
are made daily and adopted by common consent.
The same has been done in all ages. The Roman
of Italy distinguished the Roman of Greece by
the epithet <em>Gr&aelig;culus</em>, and attributed to him, as
characteristic peculiarities, want of courage and
boastful loquacity. He laughed at the colonist of
Carthage, whom he pretended to recognize among<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
thousands by his litigious spirit and bad faith.
The Alexandrians passed for wily, insolent, and
seditious. Yet the doctrine of equality was as
universally received among the Romans of that
period as it is among ourselves. If, then, various
nations display qualities so different; if some are
eager for war and glory; others, lovers of their
ease and comfort, it follows that their destinies
must be very diverse. The strongest will act in
the great tragedy of history the roles of kings and
heroes, the weaker will be content with the humbler
parts.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the ingenuity of our times
has succeeded in reconciling the universally adopted
belief in the special character of each nation
with the no less general conviction that they are
all equal. Yet this contradiction is very flagrant,
the more so as its partisans are not behindhand in
extolling the superiority of the Anglo-Saxons of
North America over all the other nations of the
same continent. It is true that they ascribe that
superiority to the influence of political institutions.
But they will hardly contest the characteristic
aptitude of the countrymen of Penn and Washington,
to establish wherever they go liberal forms of
government, and their still more valuable ability
to preserve them, when once established. Is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
this a very high prerogative allotted to that branch
of the human family? the more precious, since so
few of the groups that have ever inhabited the
globe possessed it.</p>

<p>I know that my opponents will not allow me an
easy victory. They will object to me the immense
potency of manners and institutions; they will
show me how much the spirit of the government,
by its inherent and irresistible force, influences the
development of a nation; how vastly different will
be its progress when fostered by liberty or crushed
by despotism. This argument, however, by no
means invalidates my position.</p>

<p>Political institutions can have but two origins:
either they emanate from the people which is to be
governed by them, or they are the invention of a
foreign nation, by whom they are imposed, or from
whom they are copied.</p>

<p>In the former case, the institutions are necessarily
moulded upon the instincts and wants of the
people; and if, through carelessness or ignorance,
they are in aught incompatible with either, such
defects will soon be removed or remedied. In
every independent community the law may be said
to emanate from the people; for though they have
not apparently the power of promulgating it, it
cannot be applicable to them unless it is consonant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
with their views and sentiments: it must be the
reflex of the national character.<a name="FNanchor-64" id="FNanchor-64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> The wise law-giver,
to whose superior genius his countrymen
seem solely indebted, has but given a voice to the
wants and desires of all. The mere theorist, like
Draco, finds his code a dead letter, and destined
soon to give place to the institutions of the more
judicious philosopher who would give to his compatriots
"not the best laws possible, but such
only as they were capable of receiving." When
Charles I., guided by the fatal counsels of the Earl
of Strafford, attempted to curb the English nation
under the yoke of absolutism, king and minister
were treading the bloody quagmire of theories.
But when Ferdinand the Catholic ordered those
terrible, but, in the then condition of the nation,
politically necessary persecutions of the Spanish
Moors, or when Napoleon re-established religion
and authority in France, and flattered the military
spirit of the nation&mdash;both these potentates had
rightly understood the genius of their subjects,
and were building upon a solid and practical
foundation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
False institutions, often beautiful on paper, are
those which are not conformed to the national
virtues <em>or failings</em>, and consequently unsuitable
to the country, though perhaps perfectly practicable
and highly useful in a neighboring state.
Such institutions, were they borrowed from the
legislation of the angels, will produce nothing but
discord and anarchy. Others, on the contrary,
which the theorist will eschew, and the moralist
blame in many points, or perhaps throughout, may
be the best adapted to the community. Lycurgus
was no theorist; his laws were in strict accordance
with the spirit and manners of his countrymen.<a name="FNanchor-65" id="FNanchor-65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a>
The Dorians of Sparta were few in number, valiant,
and rapacious; false institutions would have
made them but petty villains&mdash;Lycurgus changed
them into heroic brigands.<a name="FNanchor-66" id="FNanchor-66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a></p>

<p>The influence of laws and political institutions
is certainly very great; they preserve and invigorate
the genius of a nation, define its objects, and
help to attain them; but though they may develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
powers, they cannot create them where they do not
already exist. They first receive their imprint
from the nation, and then return and confirm it.
In other words, it is the nation that fashions the
laws, before the laws, in turn, can fashion the nation.
Another proof of this fact are the changes and modifications
which they undergo in the course of time.</p>

<p>I have already said above, that in proportion as
nations advance in civilization, and extend their
territory and power, their ethnical character, and,
with it, their instincts, undergo a gradual alteration.
New manners and new tendencies prevail,
and soon give rise to a series of modifications, the
more frequent and radical as the influx of blood
becomes greater and the fusion more complete.</p>

<p>England, where the ethnical changes have been
slower and less considerable than in any other European
country, preserves to this day the basis of
the social system of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. The municipal organization of the times
of the Plantagenets and the Tudors flourishes in
almost all its ancient vigor. There is the same
participation of the nobility in the government,
and the same manner of composing that nobility;
the same respect for ancient families, united to an
appreciation of those whose merits raise them
above their class. Since the accession of James I.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and still more since the union, in Queen Anne's
reign, there has indeed been an influx of Scotch
and Irish blood; foreign nations have also, though
imperceptibly, furnished their contingent to the
mixture; alterations have consequently become
more frequent of late, but without, as yet, touching
the original spirit of the constitution.</p>

<p>In France, the ethnical elements are much more
numerous, and their mixtures more varied; and
there it has repeatedly happened that the principal
power of the state passed suddenly from the hands
of one race to those of another. Changes, rather
than modifications, have therefore taken place in
the social and political system; and the changes
were abrupt or radical, in proportion as these races
were more or less dissimilar. So long as the north
of France, where the Germanic element prevailed,
preponderated in the policy of the country, the
fabric of feudalism, or rather its inform remains,
maintained their ground. After the expulsion of
the English in the fifteenth century, the provinces
of the centre took the lead. Their efforts, under
the guidance of Charles VII., had recently restored
the national independence, and the Gallo-Roman
blood naturally predominated in camp and council.
From this time dates the introduction of the
taste for military life and foreign conquests, peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184">[Pg 184]</a></span>to the Celtic race, and the tendency to concentrate
and consolidate the sovereign authority,
which characterized the Roman. The road being
thus prepared, the next step towards the establishment
of absolute power was made at the end of
the sixteenth century, by the Aquitanian followers
of Henry IV., who had still more of the Roman
than of the Celtic blood in their veins. The centralization
of power, resulting from the ascendency
of the southern populations, soon gave Paris an
overweening preponderance, and finally made it,
what it now is, the sovereign of the state. This
great capital, this modern Babel, whose population
is a motley compound of all the most varied ethnical
elements, no longer had any motive to love or
respect any tradition or peculiar tendency, and,
coming to a complete rupture with the past, hurried
France into a series of political and social
experiments of doctrines the most remote from,
and repulsive to, the ancient customs and traditional
tendencies of the realm.</p>

<p>These examples seem to me sufficient to prove
that political institutions, when not imposed by
foreign influence, take their mould from the national
character, not only in the first place, but
throughout all subsequent changes. Let us now
examine the second case, when a foreign code is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<i>nolens volens</i>, forced upon a nation by a superior
power.</p>

<p>There are few instances of such attempts. Indeed,
they were never made on a grand scale, by
any truly sagacious governments of either ancient
or modern times. The Romans were too politic
to indulge in such hazardous experiments. Alexander,
before them, had never ventured it, and his
successors, convinced, either by reason or instinct, of
the futility of such efforts, had been contented to
reign, like the conqueror of Darius, over a vast
mosaic of nations, each of which retained its own
habits, manners, laws, and administrative forms,
and, at least so long as it preserved its ethnical
identity, resembled its fellow-subjects in nothing
but submission to the same fiscal and military
regulations.</p>

<p>There were, it is true, among the nations subdued
by the Romans, some whose codes contained
practices so utterly repugnant to their masters,
that the latter could not possibly have tolerated
them. Such were the human sacrifices of the
Druids, which were, indeed, visited with the severest
penalties. But the Romans, with all their
power, never succeeded in completely extirpating
this barbarous rite. In the Narbonnese, the victory
was easy, for the Gallic population had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
been almost completely replaced by Roman colonists;
but the more intact tribes of the interior
provinces made an obstinate resistance; and, in
the peninsula of Brittany, where, in the fourth century,
a British colony re-imported the ancient instincts
with the ancient blood, the population, in
spite of the Romans, continued, either from patriotism
or veneration for their ancient traditions, to
butcher fellow-beings on their altars, as often as
they could elude the vigilance of their masters.
All revolts began with the restoration of this
fearful feature of the national creed, and even
Christianity could not entirely efface its traces,
until after protracted and strenuous efforts. As
late as the seventeenth century, the shipwrecked
were murdered, and wrecks plundered in all the
maritime provinces where the Kimric blood had
preserved itself unmixed. These barbarous customs
were in accordance with the manners of a
race which, not being yet sufficiently admixed,
still remained true to its irrepressible instincts.</p>

<p>One characteristic of European civilization is
its intolerance. Conscious of its pre-eminence, we
are prone to deny the existence of any other, or,
at least, to consider it as the standard of all. We
look with supreme contempt upon all nations that
are not within its pale, and when they fall under
our influence, we attempt to convert them to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
views and modes of thinking. Institutions which
we know to be good and useful, but which persuasion
fails to propagate among nations to whose
instincts they are foreign, we force upon them by
the power of our arms. Where are the results?
Since the sixteenth century, when the European
spirit of discovery and conquest penetrated to the
east, it does not seem to have operated the slightest
change in the manners and mode of existence
of the populations which it subjected.</p>

<p>I have already adduced the example of British
India. All the other European possessions present
the same spectacle. The aborigines of
Java, though completely subjugated by the
Dutch, have not yet made the first step towards
embracing the manners of their conquerors.
Java, at this day, preserves the social regulations
of the time of its independence. In South America,
where Spain ruled with unrestrained power
for centuries, what effect has it produced? The
ancient empires, it is true, are no longer; their
traces, even, are almost obliterated. But while
the native has not risen to the level of his conqueror,
the latter has been degraded by the mixture
of blood.<a name="FNanchor-67" id="FNanchor-67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a>
In the North, a different method has<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page188" id="page188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
been pursued, but with results equally negative;
nay, in the eyes of philanthropy, more deplorable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
for, while the Spanish Indians have at least increased
in numbers,<a name="FNanchor-68" id="FNanchor-68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> and even mixed with their
masters, to the Red-Man of the North, the contact
with the Anglo-Saxon race has been death. The
feeble remnants of these wretched tribes are fast
disappearing, and disappearing as uncivilized, as
uncivilizable, as their ancestors. In Oceanica, the
same observation holds good. The number of
aborigines is daily diminishing. The European
may disarm them, and prevent them from doing
him injury, but change them he cannot. Where-ever
he is master, they no longer eat one another,
but they fill themselves with firewater, and this
novel species of brutishness is all they learn of
European civilization.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, two governments framed by
nations of a different race, after our models: that
of the Sandwich Islands, and that of St. Domingo.
A glance at these two countries will complete the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
proof of the futility of any attempts to give to a
nation institutions not suggested by its own genius.</p>

<p>In the Sandwich Islands, the representative system
shines with full lustre. We there find an Upper
House, a Lower House, a ministry who govern,
and a king who reigns; nothing is wanted. Yet
all this is mere decoration; the wheel-work that
moves the whole machine, the indispensable motive
power, is the corps of missionaries. To them alone
belongs the honor of finding the ideas, of presenting
them, and carrying them through, either by
their personal influence over their neophytes, or,
if need be, by threats. It may be doubted, however,
whether the missionaries, if they had no other
instruments but the king and chambers, would not,
after struggling for a while against the inaptitude
of their pupils, find themselves compelled to take
a more direct, and, consequently, more apparent
part in the management of affairs. This difficulty
is obviated by the establishment of a ministry
composed of Europeans, or half-bloods. Between
them and the missionaries, all public affairs are
prearranged; the rest is only for show. King
Kamehameha III. is, it seems, a man of ability.
For his own account, he has abandoned tattooing,
and although he has not yet succeeded in dissuading
all his courtiers from this agreeable practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
he enjoys the satisfaction of seeing their countenances
adorned with comparatively slight designs.
The mass of the nation, the country nobility and
common people, persist upon this as all other
points, in the ancient ideas and customs.<a name="FNanchor-69" id="FNanchor-69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> Still, a
variety of causes tend to daily increase the European
population of the Isles. The proximity of
California makes them a point of great interest to
the far-seeing energy of our nations. Runaway
sailors, and mutineers, are no longer the only
white colonists; merchants, speculators, adventurers
of all sorts, collect there in considerable
numbers, build houses, and become permanent
settlers. The native population is gradually becoming
absorbed in the mixture with the whites.
It is highly probable that, ere long, the present
representative form of government will be superseded
by an administration composed of delegates
from one or all of the great maritime powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Of one thing I feel firmly convinced, that these
imported institutions will take firm root in the
country, but the day of their final triumph, by a
necessary synchronism, will be that of the extinction
of the native race.</p>

<p>In St. Domingo, national independence is intact.
There are no missionaries exercising absolute,
though concealed, control, no foreign ministry
governing in the European spirit; everything is
left to the genius and inspiration of the population.
In the Spanish part of the island, this population
consists of mulattoes. I shall not speak of them.
They seem to imitate, in some fashion, the simplest
and easiest features of our civilization. Like all
half-breeds, they have a tendency to assimilate
with that branch of their genealogy which does
them most honor. They are, therefore, capable
of practising, in some degree, our usages. The
absolute question of the capacity of races cannot be
studied among them. Let us cross the mountain
ridge which separates the republic of Dominica
from the empire of Hayti.</p>

<p>There we find institutions not only similar to
ours, but founded upon the most recent maxims
of our political wisdom. All that, since sixty
years, the voice of the most refined liberalism has
proclaimed in the deliberative assemblies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Europe, all that the most zealous friends of the
freedom and dignity of man have written, all the
declarations of rights and principles, have found
an echo on the banks of Artibonite. No trace of
Africa remains in the <em>written</em> laws, or the <em>official</em>
language; the recollections of the land of Ham
are <em>officially</em> expunged from every mind; once
more, the institutions are completely European.
Let us now examine how they harmonize with the
manners.</p>

<p>What a contrast! The manners are as depraved,
as beastly, as ferocious as in Dahomey<a name="FNanchor-70" id="FNanchor-70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> or the country
of the Fellatahs. The same barbarous love of
ornament, combined with the same indifference to
form; beauty consists in color, and provided a garment
is of gaudy red, and adorned with imitation
gold, taste is little concerned with useless attention
to materials or fitness; and as for cleanliness, this
is a superfluity for which no one cares. You desire
an audience with some high functionary: you
are ushered into the presence of an athletic negro,
stretched on a wooden bench, his head wrapped
in a dirty, tattered handkerchief, and surmounted
by a three-cornered hat, profusely decorated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
gold. The general apparel consists of an embroidered
coat (without suitable nether-garments), a
huge sword, and slippers. You converse with this
mass of flesh, and are anxious to discover what
ideas can occupy a mind under so unpromising an
exterior. You find an intellect of the lowest order
combined with the most savage pride, which can
be equalled only by as profound and incurable a
laziness. If the individual before you opens his
mouth, he will retail all the hackneyed common-places
that the papers have wearied you with for
the last half century. This barbarian knows them
by heart; he has very different interests, different
instincts; he has no ideas of his own. He will
talk like Baron Holbach, reason like Grimm, and
at the bottom has no serious care except chewing
tobacco, drinking spirits, butchering his enemies,
and propitiating his sorcerers. The rest of the
time he sleeps.</p>

<p>The state is divided into two factions, not separated
by incompatibility of politics, but of color&mdash;the
negroes and the mulattoes. The latter, doubtless,
are superior in intelligence, as I have already
remarked with regard to the Dominicans. The
European blood has modified the nature of the
African, and in a community of whites, with good
models constantly before their eyes, these men<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
might be converted into useful members of society.
But, unfortunately, the superiority of numbers
belongs at present to the negroes, and these,
though removed from Africa by several generations,
are the same as in their native clime. Their
supreme felicity is idleness; their supreme reason,
murder. Among the two divisions of the island
the most intense hatred has always prevailed. The
history of independent Hayti is nothing but a long
series of massacres: massacres of mulattoes by the
negroes, when the latter were strongest; of the
negroes by the mulattoes, when the power was in
their hands. The institutions, with all their boasted
liberality and philanthropy, are of no use whatever.
They sleep undisturbedly and impotently
upon the paper on which they were written, and
the savage instincts of the population reign supreme.
Conformably to the law of nature which
I pointed out before, the negro, who belongs to a
race exhibiting little aptitude for civilization, entertains
the most profound horror for all other
races. Thus we see the Haytien negroes energetically
repel the white man from their territory,
and forbid him even to enter it; they would also
drive out the mulattoes, and contemplate their
ultimate extermination. Hostility to the foreigner
is the <i>primum mobile</i> of their local policy. Owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to the innate laziness of the race, agriculture is
abandoned, industry not known even by name,
commerce drivelling; misery prevents the increase
of the population, while continual wars, insurrections,
and military executions diminish it continually.
The inevitable and not very remote
consequence of such a condition of things is to
convert into a desert a country whose fertility and
natural resources enriched generations of planters,
which in exports and commercial activity surpassed
even Cuba.<a name="FNanchor-71" id="FNanchor-71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
These examples of St. Domingo and the Sandwich
Islands seem to me conclusive. I cannot,
however, forbear, before definitely leaving the subject,
from mentioning another analogous fact, the
peculiar character of which greatly confirms my
position. I allude to the attempts of the Jesuit
missionaries to civilize the natives of Paraguay.<a name="FNanchor-72" id="FNanchor-72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a></p>

<p>These missionaries, by their exalted intelligence
and self-sacrificing courage, have excited universal
admiration; and the most decided enemies of
their order have never refused them an unstinted
tribute of praise. If foreign institutions have ever
had the slightest chance of success with a nation,
these assuredly had it, based as they were upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the power of religious feelings, and supported and
applied with a tact as correct as it was refined.
The fathers were of the pretty general opinion
that barbarism was to nations what childhood is
to the individual, and that the more savage and
untutored we find a people, the younger we may
conclude them to be. To educate their neophytes
to adolescence, they therefore treated them like
children. Their government was as firm in its
views and commands as it was mild and affectionate
in its forms. The aborigines of the American
continent have generally a tendency to republicanism;
a monarchy or aristocracy is rarely found
among them, and then in a very restricted form.
The Guaranis of Paraguay did not differ, in this
respect, from their congeners. By a happy circumstance,
however, these tribes displayed rather more
intelligence and less ferocity than their neighbors,
and seemed capable, to some extent, of conceiving
new wants and adopting new ideas. About one
hundred and twenty thousand souls were collected
in the villages of the missions, under the guidance
of the fathers. All that experience, daily study,
and active charity could teach the Jesuits, was
employed for the benefit of their pupils; incessant
efforts were made to hasten success, without hazarding
it by rashness. In spite of all these cares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
however, it was soon felt that the most absolute
authority over the neophytes could hardly constrain
them to persist in the right path, and occasions
were not wanting that revealed the little real
solidity of the edifice.<a name="FNanchor-73" id="FNanchor-73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a></p>

<p>When the measures of Count Aranda deprived
Paraguay of its pious and skilful civilizers, the
sad truth appeared in complete light. The Guaranis,
deprived of their spiritual guides, refused
all confidence in the lay directors sent them by the
Spanish crown. They showed no attachment to
their new institutions. Their taste for savage life
revived, and at present there are but thirty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
little villages still vegetating on the banks of the
Parana, the Paraguay, and Uraguay, and these
contain a considerable nucleus of half-breed population.
The rest have returned to the forest, and
live there in as savage a state as the western tribes
of the same stock, the Guaranis and Cirionos. I
will not say that the deserters have readopted
their ancient manners completely, but there is little
trace left of the pious missionaries' labors, and
this because it is given to no human race to be
oblivious of its instincts, nor to abandon the path
in which the Creator has placed them.</p>

<p>It may be supposed, had the Jesuits continued to
direct their missions in Paraguay, that their efforts,
assisted by time, would have been crowned with
better success. I am willing to concede this, but
on one condition only, always the same: that a
group of Europeans would gradually have settled
in the country under the protection of the Jesuit
directors. These would have modified, and finally
completely transformed the native blood, and a
state would have been formed, bearing probably
an aboriginal name, whose inhabitants might have
prided themselves upon descending from autochthonic
ancestors, though as completely belonging
to Europe as the institutions by which they might
be governed.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="center">THIS DIVERSITY IS NOT THE RESULT OF GEOGRAPHICAL
SITUATION.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>America&mdash;Ancient empires&mdash;Phenicians and Romans&mdash;Jews&mdash;Greece
and Rome&mdash;Commercial cities of Europe&mdash;Isthmus of
Darien.</p></div>


<p>It is impossible to leave entirely out of the
question the influence which climate, the nature of
the soil, and topographical circumstances, exert
upon the development of nations. This influence,
so much overrated by many of the learned, I shall
investigate more fully, although I have rapidly
glanced at it already, in another place.</p>

<p>It is a very common opinion that a nation living
under a temperate sky, not too warm to enervate
the man, nor too cold to render the soil unproductive;
on the shores of large rivers, affording extensive
and commodious means of communication;
in plains and valleys adapted to varied cultivation;
at the foot of mountains pregnant with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
useful and precious ores&mdash;that a nation thus favored
by nature, would soon be prompted to cast off
barbarism, and progress rapidly in civilization.<a name="FNanchor-74" id="FNanchor-74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a>
On the other hand, and by the same reasoning, it
is easily admitted that tribes, charred by an ardent
sun, or benumbed by unceasing cold, and having
no territory save sterile rocks, would be much
more liable to remain in a state of barbarism.
According to this hypothesis, the intellectual powers
of man could be developed only by the aid of
external nature, and all his worth and greatness
are not implanted in him, but in the objects without
and around. Specious as is this opinion at
first sight, it has against it all the numerous facts
which observation furnishes.</p>

<p>Nowhere, certainly, is there a greater variety of
soil and climate than in the extensive Western Continent.
Nowhere are there more fertile regions,
milder skies, larger and more numerous rivers.
The coasts are indented with gulfs and bays; deep
and magnificent harbors abound; the most valuable
riches of the mineral kingdom crop out of the
ground; nature has lavished on the soil her
choicest and most variegated vegetable productions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203">[Pg 203]</a></span>and the woods and prairies swarm with alimentary
species of animals, presenting still more
substantial resources. And yet, the greater part
of these happy countries is inhabited, and has been
for a series of centuries, by tribes who ignore the
most mediocre exploration of all these treasures.</p>

<p>Several of them seem to have been in the way
of doing better. A meagre culture, a rude knowledge
of the art of working metals, may be observed
in more than one place. Several useful
arts, practised with some ingenuity, still surprise
the traveller. But all this is really on a very
humble scale, and never formed what might be
termed a civilization. There certainly has existed
at some very remote period, a nation which inhabited
the vast region extending from Lake Erie
to the Mexican Gulf. There can be no doubt that
the country lying between the Alleghany and the
Rocky Mountains, and extending from Lake Erie
to the Gulf of Mexico, was, at some very remote
epoch, inhabited by a nation that has left remarkable
traces of its existence behind.<a name="FNanchor-75" id="FNanchor-75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> The remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of buildings, inscriptions on rocks, the tumuli,<a name="FNanchor-76" id="FNanchor-76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a>
and mummies which they inclose, indicate a high
degree of intellectual culture. But there is no
evidence that between this mysterious people and
the tribes now wandering over its tombs, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
any very near affinity. However this may be, if by
inheritance or slavish imitation the now existing
aborigines derive their first knowledge of the arts
which they now rudely practise, from the former
masters of the soil, we cannot but be struck by
their incapacity of perfecting what they had been
taught; and I see in this a new motive for adhering
to my opinion, that a nation placed amid the
most favorable geographical circumstances, is not,
therefore, destined to arrive at civilization.</p>

<p>On the contrary, there is between the propitiousness
of soil and climate and the establishment
of civilization, a complete independence. India
was a country which required fertilization; so was
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor-77" id="FNanchor-77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> Here we have two very celebrated centres
of human culture and development. China,
though very productive in some parts, presented
in others difficulties of a very serious character.
The first events recorded in its history are struggles
with rivers that had burst their bonds; its
heroes are victors over the ruthless flood; the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206">[Pg 206]</a></span>emperors distinguished themselves by excavating
canals and draining marshes. The country
of the Tigris and Euphrates, the theatre of Assyrian
splendor and hallowed by our most sacred
traditions, those regions where, Syncellus says,
wheat grew spontaneously, possess a soil so little
productive, when unassisted by art, that only a
vast and laborious system of irrigation can render
it capable of giving the means of subsistence to
its inhabitants. Now that the canals are filled up
or obstructed, sterility has reassumed its former
dominion. I am, therefore, inclined to think that
nature had not so greatly favored these countries
as is usually supposed. Yet, I shall not discuss
this point.</p>

<p>I am willing to admit that China, Egypt, India,
and Mesopotamia were regions perfectly adapted
in every respect to the establishment of great empires,
and the consequent development of brilliant
civilizations. But it cannot be disputed that these
nations, to profit by these superior advantages,
must have previously brought their social system
to a high degree of perfection. Before the great
watercourses became the highways of commerce,
industry, or at least agriculture, must have flourished
to some extent. The great advantages accorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207">[Pg 207]</a></span>to these countries presuppose, therefore,
in the nations that have profited by them, a peculiar
intellectual vocation, and even a certain anterior
degree of civilization. But from these specially
favored regions let us glance elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the Phenicians migrated from the southeast,
they fixed their abode on an arid, rocky
coast, inclosed by steep and ragged mountains.
Such a geographical situation would appear to
preclude a people from any expansion, and force
them to remain forever dependent on the produce
of their fisheries for sustenance. The utmost that
could be expected of them was to see them petty
pirates. They were pirates, indeed, but on a magnificent
scale; and, what is more, they were bold
and successful merchants and speculators. They
planted colonies everywhere, while the barren
rocks of the mother country were covered with the
palaces and temples of a wealthy and luxurious
community. Some will say, that "the very unpropitiousness
of external circumstances forced the
founders of Tyre and Sidon to become what they
were. Necessity is the mother of invention; their
misery spurred them on to exertion; had they inhabited
the plains of Damascus, they would have
been content with the peaceful products of agriculture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208">[Pg 208]</a></span>and would probably never have become an
illustrious nation."<a name="FNanchor-78" id="FNanchor-78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a></p>

<p>And why does not misery spur on other nations
placed under similar circumstances? The Kabyles
of Morocco are an ancient race; they have had
sufficient time for reflection, and, moreover, every
possible inducement for mere imitation; yet they
have never imagined any other method for alleviating
their wretched lot except petty piracy. The
unparalleled facilities for commerce afforded by the
Indian archipelago and the island clusters of the
Pacific, have never been improved by the natives;
all the peaceful and profitable relations were left
in the hands of foreign races&mdash;the Chinese, Malays,
and Arabs; where commerce has fallen into the
hands of a semi-indigenous or half-breed population,
it has instantly commenced to languish.
What conclusions can we deduce from these observations
than that pressing wants are not sufficient
for inciting a nation to profit by the natural
facilities of its coasts and islands, and that some
special aptitude is needed for establishing a commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209">[Pg 209]</a></span>state even in localities best adapted for
that purpose.</p>

<p>But I shall not content myself with proving that
the social and political aptitudes of races are not
dependent on geographical situations, whether these
be favorable or unfavorable; I shall, moreover,
endeavor to show that these aptitudes have no sort
of relation with any exterior circumstances. The
Armenians, in their almost inaccessible mountains,
where so many other nations have vegetated in a
state of barbarism from generation to generation,
and without any access to the sea, attained, already
at a remote period, a high state of civilization. The
Jews found themselves in an analogous position;
they were surrounded by tribes who spoke kindred
dialects, and who, for the most part, were nearly
related to them in blood. Yet, they excelled all
these groups. They were warriors, agriculturists,
and merchants. Under a government in which
theocracy, monarchy, patriarchal authority, and
popular will, were singularly complicated and
balanced, they traversed centuries of prosperity
and glory. The difficulties which the narrow
limits of their patrimonial domain opposed to
their expansion, were overcome by an intelligent
system of emigration. What was this famous
Canaan? Modern travellers bear witness to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
laborious and well-directed efforts by which the
Jewish agriculturists maintained the factitious
fertility of their soil. Since the chosen race no
longer inhabits these mountains and plains, the
wells where Jacob's flocks drank are dried up;
Naboth's vineyard is invaded by the desert,
Achab's palace-gardens filled with thistles. In
this miserable corner of the world, what were the
Jews? A people dextrous in all they undertook,
a free, powerful, intelligent people, who, before
losing bravely, and against a much superior foe,
the title of independent nation, had furnished to
the world almost as many doctors as merchants.<a name="FNanchor-79" id="FNanchor-79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a></p>

<p>Let us look at Greece. Arcadia was the paradise
of the shepherd, and B&oelig;otia, the favored land
of Ceres and Triptolemus: yet, Arcadia and B&oelig;otia
play but a very inferior part in history. The
wealthy Corinth, the favorite of Plutus and Venus,
also appears in the second rank. To whom pertains
the glory of Grecian history? To Attica,
whose whitish, sandy soil afforded a scanty sustenance
to puny olive-trees; to Athens, whose principal
commerce consisted in books and statues.
Then to Sparta, shut up in a narrow valley between
masses of rocks, where victory went in search of it.</p>

<p>Who would dare to assert that Rome owed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
universal empire to her geographical position? In
the poor district of Latium, on the banks of a tiny
stream emptying its waters on an almost unknown
coast, where neither Greek nor Phenician vessel
ever landed, except by accident, the future mistress
of the world was born. So soon as the nations
of the earth obeyed the Roman standard,
politicians found the metropolis ill-placed, and
the eternal city was neglected: even abandoned.
The first emperors, being chiefly occupied with the
East, resided in Greece almost continually. Tiberius
chose Caprea, in the centre of his empire. His
successors went to Antioch. Several lived at Trebia.
Finally, a decree deprived Rome of the very name
of capital, and gave it to Milan. If the Romans
have conquered the world, it is certainly in spite
of the locality whence issued forth their first armies,
and not on account of its advantages.</p>

<p>In modern history, the proofs of the correctness
of my position are so abundant, that I
hardly know how to select. I see prosperity
abandoning the coasts of the Mediterranean, evidence
that it was not dependent on them. The
great commercial cities of the Middle Ages rise
where no theorist of a preceding age could have
predicted them. Novogorod flourishes in an almost
arctic region, Bremen on a coast nearly as cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
The Hanse-towns of Germany rise in a country
where civilization has scarcely dawned; Venice
appears at the head of a long, narrow gulf. Political
preponderance belongs to places before unknown.
Lyons, Toulouse, Narbonne, Marseilles,
Bordeaux, lose the importance assigned them by
the Romans, and Paris becomes the metropolis&mdash;Paris,
then a third-rate town, too far from the sea
for commerce, too near it for the Norman barges.
In Italy, cities formerly obscure, surpass the capital
of the popes. Ravenna rises in the midst of
marshes; Amalfi, for a long time, enjoys extensive
dominion. It must be observed, that in all these
changes accident has no part: they all are the
result of the presence of a victorious and preponderating
race. It is not the place which determines
the importance of a nation, it is the nation which
gives to the place its political and economical importance.</p>

<p>I do not, however, deny the importance of certain
situations for commercial depots, or for capitals.
The observations made with regard to
Alexandria and Constantinople, are incontestable.<a name="FNanchor-80" id="FNanchor-80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a>
There are, upon our globe, various points which
may be called the keys of the world. Thus, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
obvious that a city, built on the proposed canal
which is to pierce the Isthmus of Darien, would
act an important part in the affairs of the world.</p>

<p>But, such a part a nation may act well or badly,
or even not at all, according to its merits. Aggrandize
Chagres, and let the two oceans unite under
her walls, the destiny of the city would depend
entirely on the race by which it was peopled. If
this race be worthy of their good fortune, they will
soon discover whether Chagres be the point whence
the greatest benefits can be derived from the union
of the two oceans; and, if it is not, they will leave
it, and then, untrammelled, develop elsewhere their
brilliant destinies.<a name="FNanchor-81" id="FNanchor-81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
The first question that suggests itself to the
thinking mind, is a startling one. If some races
are so vastly inferior in all respects, can they comprehend
the truths of the gospel, or are they forever
to be debarred from the blessing of salvation?</p>

<p>In answer, I unhesitatingly declare my firm
conviction, that the pale of salvation is open to
them all, and that all are endowed with equal
capacity to enter it. Writers are not wanting
who have asserted a contrary opinion. They dare
to contradict the sacred promise of the Gospel, and
deny the peculiar characteristic of our faith, which
consists in its accessibility to all men. According
to them, religions are confined within geographical
limits which they cannot transgress. But the
Christian religion knows no degrees of latitude or
longitude. There is scarcely a nation, or a tribe,
among whom it has not made converts. Statistics&mdash;imperfect,
no doubt, but, as far as they go, reliable&mdash;show
them in great numbers in the remotest
parts of the globe: nomad Mongols, in the steppes
of Asia, savage hunters in the table-lands of the
Andes; dark-hued natives of an African clime;
persecuted in China;<a name="FNanchor-82" id="FNanchor-82"></a><a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> tortured in Madagascar;
perishing under the lash in Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
But this universal capacity of receiving the
light of the gospel must not be confounded, as is
so often done, with a faculty of entirely different
character, that of social improvement. This latter
consists in being able to conceive new wants,
which, being supplied, give rise to others, and
gradually produce that perfection of the social and
political system which we call civilization. While
the former belongs equally to all races, whatever
may be their disparity in other respects, the latter
is of a purely intellectual character, and the prerogative
of certain privileged groups, to the partial
or even total exclusion of others.</p>

<p>With regard to Christianity, intellectual deficiencies
cannot be a hindrance to a race. Our
religion addresses itself to the lowly and simple,
even in preference to the great and wise of this
earth. Intellect and learning are not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to salvation. The most brilliant lights of our
church were not always found among the body
of the learned. The glorious martyrs, whom we
venerate even above the skilful and erudite defender
of the dogma, or the eloquent panegyrist of
the faith, were men who sprang from the masses of
the people; men, distinguished neither for worldly
learning, nor brilliant talents, but for the simple
virtues of their lives, their unwavering faith, their
self-devotion. It is exactly in this that consists
one great superiority of our religion over the
most elaborate and ingenious systems devised by
philosophers, that it is intelligible to the humblest
capacity as well as to the highest. The poor
Esquimaux of Labrador may be as good and as
pure a Christian as the most learned prelate in
Europe.</p>

<p>But we now come to an error which, in its various
phases, has led to serious consequences. The
utilitarian tendency of our age renders us prone
to seek, even in things sacred, a character of material
usefulness. We ascribe to the influence of
Christianity a certain order of things, which we
call <em>Christian civilization</em>.</p>

<p>To what political or social condition this term
can be fitly applied, I confess myself unable to
conceive. There certainly is a Pagan, a Brahmin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and Buddhistic, a Judaic civilization. There have
been, and still are, societies so intimately connected
with a more or less exclusive theological formula,
that the civilizations peculiar to them, can only be
designated by the name of their creed. In such
societies, religion is the sole source of all political
forms, all civil and social legislation; the groundwork
of the whole civilization. This union of religious
and temporal institutions, we find in the history
of every nation of antiquity. Each country had its
own peculiar divinity, which exercised a more or
less direct influence in the government,<a name="FNanchor-83" id="FNanchor-83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which laws and civilization were said to be immediately
derived. It was only when paganism began
to wane, that the politicians of Rome imagined a
separation of temporal and religious power, by
attempting a fusion of the different forms of worship,
and proclaiming the dogma of legal toleration.
When paganism was in its youth and vigor, each
city had its Jupiter, Mercury, or Venus, and the
local deity recognized neither in this world nor
the next any but compatriots.</p>

<p>But, with Christianity, it is otherwise. It chooses
no particular people, prescribes no form of government,
no social system. It interferes not in temporal
matters, has naught to do with the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
world, "its kingdom is of another." Provided it
succeeds in changing the interior man, external
circumstances are of no import. If the convert
fervently embraces the faith, and in all his actions
tries to observe its prescriptions, it inquires not
about the built of his dwelling, the cut of his
garments, or the materials of which they are composed,
his daily occupations, the regulations of his
government, the degree of despotism, or of freedom,
which pervades his political institutions. It
leaves the Chinese in his robes, the Esquimaux in
his seal-skins; the former to his rice, the latter to
his fish-oil; and who would dare to assert that the
prayers of both may not breathe as pure a faith
as those of the <em>civilized</em> European? No mode of
existence can attract its preference, none, however
humble, its disdain. It attacks no form of government,
no social institution; prescribes none, because
it has adopted none. It teaches not the art
of promoting worldly comforts, it teaches to despise
them. What, then, can we call a Christian
civilization? Had Christ, or his disciples, prescribed,
or even recommended any particular
political or social forms,<a name="FNanchor-84" id="FNanchor-84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> the term would then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
applicable. But his law may be observed under
all&mdash;of whatever nature&mdash;and is therefore superior
to them all. It is justly and truly called the
<em>Catholic</em>, or Universal.</p>

<p>And has Christianity, then, no civilizing influence?
I shall be asked. Undoubtedly; and a
very great one. Its precepts elevate and purify
the soul, and, by their purely spiritual nature, disengage
the mind from worldly things, and expand
its powers. In a merely human point of view,
the material benefits it confers on its followers are
inestimable. It softens the manners, and facilitates
the intercourse between man and his fellow-man;
it mitigates violence, and weans him from corrosive
vices. It is, therefore, a powerful promoter
of his worldly interests. But it only expands the
mind in proportion to the susceptibility of the
mind for being expanded. It does not give intellect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223">[Pg 223]</a></span>or confer talents, though it may exalt both,
and render them more useful. It does not create
new capacities, though it fosters and develops
those it finds. Where the capacities of an individual,
or a race, are such as to admit an improvement
in the mode of existence, it tends to
produce it; where such capacities are not already,
it does not give them. As it belongs to no particular
civilization, it does not compel a nation to
change its own. In fine, as it does not level all
individuals to the same intellectual standard, so it
does not raise all races to the same rank in the
political assemblage of the nations of the earth.
It is wrong, therefore, to consider the equal aptitude
of all races for the true religion, as a proof
of their intellectual equality. Though having embraced
it, they will still display the same characteristic
differences, and divergent or even opposite
tendencies. A few examples will suffice to set my
idea in a clearer light.</p>

<p>The major portion of the Indian tribes of South
America have, for centuries, been received within
the pale of the church, yet the European civilization,
with which they are in constant contact, has
never become their own.<a name="FNanchor-85" id="FNanchor-85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> The Cherokees, in the
northern part of the same continent, have nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
all been converted by the Methodist missionaries.
At this I am not surprised, but I should be greatly
so, if these tribes, without mixing with the whites,
were ever to form one of the States, and exercise
any influence in Congress. The Moravians and
Danish Lutheran missionaries in Labrador and
Greenland, have opened the eyes of the Esquimaux
to the light of religion; but their neophytes
have remained in the same social condition in
which they vegetated before. A still more forcible
illustration is afforded by the Laplanders of
Sweden, who have not emerged from the state of
barbarism of their ancestors, though the doctrine
of salvation was preached to them, and believed
by them, centuries ago.</p>

<p>I sincerely believe that all these peoples may
produce, and, perhaps, already have produced,
persons remarkable for piety and pure morals;
but I do not expect ever to see among them learned
theologians, great statesmen, able military leaders,
profound mathematicians, or distinguished artists;&mdash;any
of those superior minds, whose number and
perpetual succession are the cause of power in a
preponderating race; much less those rare geniuses
whose meteor-like appearance is productive of
permanent good only when their countrymen are
so constituted as to be able to understand them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and to advance under their direction. We cannot,
therefore, call Christianity a promoter of civilization
in the narrow and purely material sense of
some writers.</p>

<p>Many of my readers, while admitting my observations
in the main to be correct, will object that
the modifying influence of religion upon the manners
must produce a corresponding modification
of the institutions, and finally in the whole social
system. The propagators of the gospel, they will
say, are almost always&mdash;though not necessarily&mdash;from
a nation superior in civilization to the one
they visit. In their personal intercourse, therefore,
with their neophytes, the latter cannot but
acquire new notions of material well-being. Even
the political system may be greatly influenced by
the relations between instructor and pupil. The
missionary, while he provides for the spiritual
welfare of his flock, will not either neglect their
material wants. By his teaching and example,
the savage will learn how to provide against
famine, by tilling the soil. This improvement in
his condition once effected, he will soon be led to
build himself a better dwelling, and to practise
some of the simpler useful arts. Gradually, and
by careful training, he may acquire sufficient taste
for things purely intellectual, to learn the alphabet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226">[Pg 226]</a></span>or even, as in the case of the Cherokees, to
invent one himself. In course of time, if the
missionaries' labors are crowned with success, they
may, perhaps, so firmly implant their manners
and mode of living among this formerly savage
tribe, that the traveller will find among them well-cultivated
fields, numerous flocks, and, like these
same Cherokees, and the Creeks on the southern
banks of the Arkansas, black slaves to work on
their plantations.</p>

<p>Let us see how far facts correspond with this
plausible argument. I shall select the two nations
which are cited as being the furthest advanced in
European civilization, and their example will, it
seems to me, demonstrate beyond a doubt, how
impossible it is for any race to pursue a career in
which their own nature has not placed them.</p>

<p>The Cherokees and Creeks are said to be the
remnants or descendants of the Alleghanian Race,
the supposed builders of those great monuments
of which we still find traces in the Mississippi
Valley. If this be the case, these two nations may
lay claim to a natural superiority over the other
tribes of North America.</p>

<p>Deprived of their hereditary dominions by the
American government, they were forced&mdash;under a
treaty of transplantation&mdash;to emigrate to regions<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
selected for them by the latter. There they were
placed under the superintendence of the Minister
of War, and of Protestant missionaries, who finally
succeeded in persuading them to embrace the mode
of life they now lead. Mr. Prichard,<a name="FNanchor-86" id="FNanchor-86"></a><a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> my authority
for these facts, and who derives them himself from
the great work of Mr. Gallatin,<a name="FNanchor-87" id="FNanchor-87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> asserts that, while
all the other Indian tribes are continually diminishing,
these are steadily increasing in numbers. As
a proof of this, he alleges that when Adair visited
the Cherokee tribes, in 1762, the number of their
warriors was estimated at 2,300; at present, their
total population amounts to 15,000 souls, including
about 1,200 negroes in their possession. When
we consider that their schools, as well as churches,
are directed by white missionaries; that the greater
number of these missionaries&mdash;being Protestants&mdash;are
probably married and have children and servants
also white, besides, very likely, a sort of
retinue of clerks and other European employees;&mdash;the
increase of the aboriginal population becomes
extremely doubtful,<a name="FNanchor-88" id="FNanchor-88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> while it is easy to conceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
pressure of the white race upon its pupils. Surrounded
on all sides by the power of the United
States, incommensurable to their imagination;
converted to the religion of their masters, which
they have, I think, sincerely embraced; treated
kindly and judiciously by their spiritual guides;
and exposed to the alternation of working or of
starving in their contracted territory;&mdash;I can understand
that it was possible to make them tillers
of the earth.</p>

<p>It would be underrating the intelligence of the
humblest, meanest specimen of our kind, to
express surprise at such a result, when we see
that, by dexterously and patiently acting upon
the passions and wants of animals, we succeed
in teaching them what their own instincts
would never have taught them. Every village<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
fair is filled with animals which are trained to
perform the oddest tricks, and is it to be wondered
at that men submitted to a rigorous system of
training, and deprived of the means of escaping
from it, should, in the end, be made to perform
certain mechanical functions of civilized life;
functions which, even in the savage state, they are
capable of understanding, though they have not
the will to practise them? This were placing
human beings lower in the scale of creation than
the learned pig, or Mr. Leonard's domino-playing
dogs.<a name="FNanchor-89" id="FNanchor-89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> Such exultation on the part of the believers
in the equality of races is little flattering to those
who excite it.</p>

<p>I am aware that this exaggeration of the intellectual
capacity of certain races is in a great
measure provoked by the notions of some very
learned and distinguished men, who pretend that
between the lowest races of men, and the highest
of apes there was but a shade of distinction. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
gross an insult to the dignity of man, I indignantly
reject. Certainly, in my estimation, the different
races are very unequally endowed, both physically
and mentally; but I should be loath to think that
in any, even in the most degraded, the unmistakable
line of demarcation between man and
brute were effaced. I recognize no link of gradation
which would connect man mentally with the
brute creation.</p>

<p>But does it follow, that because the lowest of
the human species is still unmistakably human, that
all of that species are capable of the same development?
Take a Bushman, the most hideous and
stupid of human families, and by careful training
you may teach him, or if he is already adult, his
son, to learn and practise a handicraft, even one
that requires a certain degree of intelligence. But
are we warranted thence to conclude that the nation
to which this individual belongs, is susceptible
of adopting our civilization? There is a vast
difference between mechanically practising handicrafts
and arts, the products of an advanced civilization,
and that civilization itself. Let us suppose
that the Cherokee tribes were suddenly cut
off from all connection with the American government,
the traveller, a few years hence, would find
among them very unexpected and singular institutions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231">[Pg 231]</a></span>resulting from their mixture with the
whites, but partaking only feebly of the character
of European civilization.</p>

<p>We often hear of negroes proficient in music,
negroes who are clerks in counting-rooms, who
can read, write, talk like the whites. We admire,
and conclude that the negroes are capable of everything
that whites are. Notwithstanding this admiration
and these hasty conclusions, we express
surprise at the contrast of Sclavonian civilization
with ours. We aver that the Russian, Polish, Servish
nations, are civilized only at the surface, that
none but the higher classes are in possession of
our ideas, and this, thanks to their intermixture
with the English, French, and German stock; that
the masses, on the contrary, evince a hopeless inaptitude
for participating in the forward movement
of Western Europe, although these masses have
been Christians for centuries, many of them while
our ancestors were heathens. Are the negroes,
then, more closely allied to our race than the Sclavonic
nations? On the one hand, we assert the
intellectual equality of the white and black races;
on the other, a disparity among subdivisions of
our own race.</p>

<p>There is a vast difference between imitation and
comprehension. The imitation of a civilization does<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not necessarily imply an eradication of the hereditary
instincts. A <em>nation</em> can be said to have adopted
a civilization, only when it has the power to progress
in it unprompted, and without guidance. Instead
of extolling the intelligence of savages in handling
a plough, after being shown; in spelling and reading,
after they have been taught; let a single example
be alleged of a tribe in any of the numerous
countries in contact with Europeans, which, with
our religion, has also made the ideas, institutions,
and manners of a European nation so completely
its own, that the whole social and political machinery
moves forward as easily and naturally as in
our States. Let an example be alleged of an extra-European
nation, among whom the art of printing
produces effects analogous to those it produces
among us; where new applications of our discoveries
are attempted; where our systems of philosophy
give birth to new systems; where our arts
and sciences flourish.</p>

<p>But, no; I will be more moderate in my demands.
I shall not ask of that nation to adopt, together
with our faith, all in which consists our individuality.
I shall suppose that it rejects it totally,
and chooses one entirely different, adapted to its
peculiar genius and circumstances. When the
eyes of that nation open to the truths of the Gospel,
it perceives that its earthly course is as encumbered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233">[Pg 233]</a></span>and wretched as its spiritual life had hitherto
been. It now begins the work of improvement,
collects its ideas, which had hitherto remained
fruitless, examines the notions of others, transforms
them, and adapts them to its peculiar circumstances;
in fact, erects, by its own power, a
social and political system, a civilization, however
humble. Where is there such a nation? The entire
records of all history may be searched in vain
for a single instance of a nation which, together
with Christianity, adopted European civilization,
or which&mdash;by the same grand change in its religious
ideas&mdash;was led to form a civilization of its
own, if it did not possess one already before.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I will show, in every part of
the world, ethnical characteristics not in the least
effaced by the adoption of Christianity. The
Christian Mongol and Tartar tribes lead the
same erratic life as their unconverted brethren,
and are as distinct from the Russian of the same
religion, who tills the soil, or plies his trade in
their midst, as they were centuries ago. Nay, the
very hostilities of race survive the adoption of a
common religion, as we have already pointed out
in a preceding chapter. The Christian religion,
then, does not equalize the intellectual disparities
of races.</p>

<p>Several of the ideas expressed by the author in the
course of the two next following chapters, seemed to
the annotator of this volume to call for a few remarks
on his part, which could not conveniently be condensed
within the limited space of foot-notes. Besides, the
text is already sufficiently encumbered with them, and
any increase in their length or number could not but
be displeasing to the eye, while it would divert attention
from the main subject. He has, therefore, taken
the liberty&mdash;an unwarranted one, perhaps&mdash;of introducing
his remarks in this form and place.</p>

<p class="tbreak">The leading proposition in this volume is, that the
civilization originated and developed by a race, is the
clearest index of its character&mdash;the mirror in which its
principal features are truthfully reflected. In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
words, that every race, capable of developing a civilization,
will develop one peculiar to itself, and impossible
to every other. This the author illustrates by the
actual state of our civilization, which he asserts to be
originated by the Teutonic race, but modified in proportion
to the admixture of that race with a different
blood. To clearly comprehend his idea, and to appreciate
the value of his arguments, it is, therefore, necessary
for the reader to take a rapid survey of the populations
comprised under the appellation <em>Teutonic</em>, and
to examine into the present geographical extension of
that race. This I shall endeavor to do, not, indeed, by
entering into an elaborate ethnological disquisition&mdash;a
task greatly beyond my powers, and the due performance
of which would require a space much larger than
the whole of this volume&mdash;but by merely grouping together
well-known facts, in such a manner as to set the
author's idea in a clearer light.</p>

<p>The words <em>Teutonic</em> and <em>Germanic</em> are generally
used synonymously, and we shall not depart from this
custom. Strict accuracy, however, would probably require
that the term Teutonic should be used as the
general appellation of all those swarms of northern
warriors, who, under various names, harassed and finally
subverted the overgrown dominion of ancient Rome,
while the term Germanic would apply to a portion of
them only. The Northern Barbarians, as the Romans
contemptuously styled them, all claimed to belong to
the "<em>Thiudu</em>," or the nation <i>par excellence</i>, and from
that word the term Teutonic is supposed to be derived.
Many of their descendants still retain the name: <em>Teutsch</em>
or <em>Deutsch</em> (German). The Romans called them <em>Germanes</em>,
from the boastful title of "the warlike," or "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
men of war," which the first invading tribes had given
themselves. These <em>Germanes</em> of the Romans were
again divided into two classes, the Saxon tribes, and
the Suevic; terms expressive of their mode of life, the
former having fixed habitations and inclosed farms, the
latter cultivating the fields by turn, and being prone to
change their abodes. The first class comprised many
other tribes besides those who figure in history, under
the name of Saxons, as the invaders and conquerors of
Britain. But as I desire to avoid all not well-authorized
distinctions, I shall use the terms Teutonic and Germanic
indiscriminately.</p>

<p>The Germans appear to have been at all times an
eminently warlike and courageous race. History first
speaks of them as warriors alarming, nay, terrifying,
the arrogant Romans, and that not in the infancy
of Rome's power, when the Samnites and Volscians
were formidable antagonists, but in the very fulness of
its strength, in the first vigor of youthful manhood,
when Italy, Spain, part of Gaul, the northern coasts
of Africa, Greece, Syria, and Asia Minor, were subdued
to the republican yoke. Then it was that the
Cimbri and Teutones invaded and harassed Italy, chilling
the mistress of the world with fear.</p>

<p>The Germans next meet us in C&aelig;sar's Commentaries.
The principal resistance which the future usurper experienced
in subduing Gaul, appears to have been
offered, not by the Gallic population, but either by
German tribes, settled in that country, or German
armies from the right banks of the Rhine, who longed
to dispute the tempting prize with the Romans. The
great general twice crossed the Rhine, but probably
more for the <em>&eacute;clat</em> of such an exploit, than with the hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of making permanent conquests. The temporary successes
gained by his imperial successors were amply
counterbalanced by the massacre of the flower of the
Roman armies.</p>

<p>At the end of the first five centuries after Christ,
nothing was left of the great Roman empire but ruins.
Every country in Northern, Western, and Southern
Europe acknowledged German masters. The tribes of
the extreme north had entered Russia, and there
established a powerful republic; the tribes of the northwest
(the Angles and Saxons) had conquered Britain;
a confederation of the southern tribes, under the name
of Franks, had conquered Gaul; the various Gothic
tribes of the east, the Heruli, the Longobardi, Ostrogoths,
etc., had subjected Italy to their arms, and disputed
its possession among themselves. Other Gothic
tribes (the Visigoths, Burgundians, and Vandals) had
shared with the Franks the beautiful tracts of Gaul,
or had carried their victorious arms to Spain, and the
northern coasts of Africa. The three most beautiful and
most fertile countries of Europe, to this day, retain the
name of their conquerors&mdash;England, France, Lombardy.</p>

<p>It is impossible now to determine with accuracy the
amount of German blood in the populations of the
various states founded by the Teutonic tribes. Yet
certain general results are easily arrived at in this interesting
investigation.</p>

<p>Thus, we know that Germany, notwithstanding its
name, contains by no means a pure Germanic population.
The fierce Scythian hordes, whom Attila led on to
the work of devastation, after the death of their leader,
incorporated themselves with various of the Teutonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
tribes. They form one of the ethnical elements of the
population of Italy, but especially of the south and
southeast of Germany. While, therefore, the population
of Northern Germany is comparatively pure
Teutonic, that of the southern and eastern portion is a
mixture of Teutonic and Sclavonian elements.</p>

<p>The Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians, are probably
the most Germanic nations of continental Europe.</p>

<p>In Spain, the Visigoths were, in a great measure,
absorbed by the native population, consisting of the
aboriginal Celtiberians and the numerous Roman colonists.
In the tenth century, an amalgamation began
with the eastern blood brought by the Arab conquerors.</p>

<p>Italy, already at the time of the downfall of Rome,
contained an extremely mixed population, drawn thither
by the all-absorbing vortex of the Eternal City. In
the north, the Germanic element had time to engraft
itself in some measure; but the south, passing into the
hands of the Byzantine emperors, received an addition
of the already mixed Greek blood of the east.</p>

<p>Gaul, at the time of the Frankish conquest, was an
extremely populous country. Beside the aboriginal
Gauls, the population consisted of numerous Roman
colonists. The Mediterranean coast of Gaul had, from
the earliest times, received Phenician, Carthaginian,
and Greek settlers, who founded there large and prosperous
cities. The original differences in the population
of Gaul are to this day perceptible. The Germanic
element preponderates in the north, where already,
in C&aelig;sar's time, the Germans had succeeded in making
permanent settlements, and in the northeast, where
the Burgundians had well-nigh extirpated and completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239">[Pg 239]</a></span>supplanted the Gallic natives.<a name="FNanchor-90" id="FNanchor-90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> But everywhere
else,<a name="FNanchor-91" id="FNanchor-91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> the Germanic element forms but a small portion
of the population, and this is well illustrated by the
striking resemblance of the character of the modern
French to that of the ancient Gauls. But though
vastly inferior in numbers, the descendants of the German
conquerors, for one thousand years, were the dominant
race in France. Until the fifteenth century, all
the higher nobility were of Frankish or Burgundian
origin. But, after the Celtic and Celto-Roman provinces
south of the Loire had rallied around a youthful
king, to reconquer their capital and best territories from
the English foe, the Frankish blood ruled with less exclusive
sway in all the higher offices of the state; and
the distinction was almost entirely lost by the accession
of the first southern dynasty, that of the Bourbons, towards
the end of the sixteenth century. The corresponding
variations in the national policy and the
exterior manifestations of the national character, Mr.
Gobineau has rapidly pointed out elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor-92" id="FNanchor-92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<p>While the population of France presents so great a
mixture of various different races, and but a slight infusion
of German blood, that of England, on the contrary,
is almost purely Teutonic. The original inhabitants
of the country were, for the most part, driven into
the mountain fastnesses of Wales by the German invaders,
where they preserve, to this day, their original<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
language. Every subsequent great addition to the
population of England was by the German race. The
Danes, and, after them, the Normans, were tribes of the
same stock as the Saxons, and all came from very nearly
the same portion of Europe. It is obvious, therefore,
that England, even after the Norman conquest, when,
for a time, the upper and the lower classes spoke different
languages, contained a more homogeneous population
than France did at the same, or any subsequent
epoch. In England, from the Saxon yeoman up to the
proudest Norman lord, all belonged to the great German
race; in France, only the nobility, while the peasants
were Gauls. The wars between the two countries
afford a striking proof of the difference of these two
races. The battles of Cressy, of Poitiers, and of Agincourt,
which will never be forgotten so long as English
poetry can find an echo in an English breast, were won
by the English against greatly superior numbers. "Victories,
indeed, they were," says Macaulay, "of which
a nation may justly be proud; for they are to be attributed
to the moral superiority of the victors, <em>a superiority
which was most striking in the lowest ranks</em>. The
knights of England found worthy rivals in the knights
of France. Chandos encountered an equal foe in Du
Guesclin. But France had no infantry that dared to
face the English bows and bills." The Celt has probably,
at no time, been inferior to the Teuton in valor;
in martial enthusiasm, he exceeds him. But, at a time
when bodily strength decided the combat, the difference
between the sturdy Saxon and the small, slight&mdash;though
active&mdash;Gaul, must have been great.</p>

<p>In this rapid and necessarily imperfect sketch, I have
endeavored to show the relative proportion of the Teutonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241">[Pg 241]</a></span>blood in the population of the various countries
of Europe. I have endeavored to direct the reader's
attention to the fact, that though it forms an element
in the population of all, it exists in perfect purity in
but few, and that England presents a happy fusion of
some of the most distinguished branches of the German
family. If we now glance at the United States, we shall
there find&mdash;at least in the first years of her national
existence&mdash;a pendant to what has been asserted of England.
The elements of the population of the original
thirteen States, were almost exclusively of English,
Lowland Scotch, Dutch, and Swedish blood; that is
to say, decidedly Germanic. Ireland was as yet slightly
represented. France had made but inconsiderable contributions
to the population. Since we have assumed
a rank among the great powers of the earth, every
portion of the inhabited globe has sent us its contingent
of blood, yet even now, the great body of the
nation belongs to the Teutonic race.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the effects of ethnical mixture.
Many consider it as decidedly beneficial, others as
decidedly deleterious. It seems to me susceptible of
mathematical demonstration, that when a very inferior
race amalgamates with one of higher order, the compound&mdash;though
superior to the one, must be inferior to
the other. In that case, therefore, mixture is injurious.
But when various branches of the same race, or nearly
cognate races mix, as in the case of the Saxons, Angles,
Danes, and Normans, the mixture cannot but be beneficial.
For, while none of the higher qualities are lost,
the compound presents a felicitous combination of some
of the virtues peculiar to each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242">[Pg 242]</a></span>If our civilization received its tone and character
from the Teutonic race, as Mr. Gobineau asserts, this
character must be most strikingly displayed wherever
that race forms the preponderating element of the
population.</p>

<p>Before investigating this question, we must cast a
glance on the manners and modes of thinking that
characterized this race in the earliest times. Unfortunately,
but few records are left to assist us in forming
a judgment. Tacitus's celebrated treatise was, probably,
more an imaginary sketch, which he wished to hold
up to a people sunk in luxury and vice, as were his
countrymen. In our times, the North American Indian
has often been held up as a model of uncorrupted simplicity,
and many touching romances have been written
on the theme, now rather hackneyed and out of fashion.
But though the noble Roman may have highly colored
the picture, the incorruptible love of truth, which
shines so brilliantly in all his works, assures us of the
truth of its outlines.</p>

<p>Of one thing we can entertain no doubt, viz: that
history nowhere shows us our Germanic forefathers in
the same state of barbarism that we find other races&mdash;many
of the American Indians, the South-Sea Islanders,
and others. In the earliest times they practised
agriculture, they cultivated rye, barley, oats and wheat.
Many of the tribes had regular farms, which were inclosed.
They knew how to work iron, an art which
even the most civilized of the American Indians had
never learned. They had extensive and complicated
political relations, often forming themselves in vast
confederacies. But, above all, they were an eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
chaste people; they respected woman,<a name="FNanchor-93" id="FNanchor-93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> and assigned to
her her legitimate place in the social circle. Marriage
with them was a sacred institution.</p>

<p>The greatest point of superiority of our civilization,
over all preceding and contemporaneous ones&mdash;a point
which Mr. Gobineau has omitted to mention&mdash;is the
high rank which woman occupies in the modern structure
of society. The boasted civilizations of Greece
and Rome, if superior in others, are vastly inferior to
us in this respect. And this glorious superiority we
owe to the pure and chaste manners of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Representative government, trial by jury, and all the
discoveries in political science upon which we pride ourselves
most, are the necessary development of their
simple institutions, to which, indeed, they can be distinctly
traced.</p>

<p>I have purposely selected these two characteristics
of the German races&mdash;respect for woman, and love of
liberty, or, what is more, a capacity for establishing
and preserving liberal institutions. The question now
resolves itself into this: Does woman occupy the highest
rank, do liberal institutions best flourish where the
Germanic race is most pure? I will not answer the
question, but beg the reader to compare the more Germanic
countries with those that are less so&mdash;England,
Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Northern
Germany, with France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Russia;
the United States and Canada, with Mexico and
the South American republics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Mr. Gobineau speaks of the utilitarian character of the
Germanic races, but furnishes no proofs of his assertion.
I shall therefore endeavor to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>Those countries which ethnology tells us contain the
most Germanic populations, viz: England, the northern
States of Europe, including Holland, and the United
States, have the entire commerce, and nearly all the
manufacture of the whole world in their hands. They
have given to mankind all the great inventions which
shed an everlasting lustre over our era. They, together,
possess nine-tenths of all the railroads built in the world,
and the greater part of the remaining tenth was built by
<em>their</em> enterprise and capital. Whatever perfection in
the useful arts one of these countries attains, is readily
adopted by all; slowly only, and sometimes never by any
of the others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find that the polite arts do
not meet, in these countries, with a very congenial soil.
Artists may flock thither, and, perhaps, reap a harvest
of gold; but they seldom stay. The admiration which
they receive is oftenest the mere dictate of fashion. It
is true that England, Denmark, Holland, Sweden, and
the United States, have produced some eminent artists,
but the mass of the population do not exhibit that innate
taste, that passionate fondness for the arts, which
we find among all classes in Italy, Spain, and to some
extent in France and Southern Germany.</p>

<p class="tbreak">Before I conclude this hasty sketch, for which I crave
the reader's indulgence, I wish to draw attention to a
striking instance of the permanency of ethnical characteristics.
The nations that most fondly and most successfully
plough the briny main, are the English, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Americans, the Swedes, Danes, Dutch. Notwithstanding
the littleness of these latter, they have successfully
competed in maritime discovery with larger nations;
and even now, own considerable and far distant colonial
possessions. The Dutch, for a time, were the greatest
maritime power in the world, and to this day carry on
an extensive and profitable commerce. History tells
us that the forefathers of these nations were distinguished
by the same nautical genius.</p>

<p>The real Saxons&mdash;the invaders of England&mdash;are
mentioned already in the middle of the second century,
by Ptolemy, as skilful sailors. In the fourth and fifth
century, they became dreaded from their piracies. They
and their confederates, the Angles, originally inhabited
the present Holstein, and the islands in the vicinity of
the Baltic coast. Their neighbors, the Danes, were
equally famous for maritime exploits. Their celebrated
vykings still live in song and tale. Their piratical incursions
and settlements in England, are known to
every schoolboy. How familiar the Normans were with
the watery element, is abundantly proved by history.
They ascended the Rhine, and other rivers, for hundreds
of miles, marking their landing-place by devastation.</p>

<p>Of the Angle, the Saxon, the Dane, and the Norman,
the present Englishman and his adventurous brother of
Massachusetts, are lineal descendants. The best sailors
in our commercial navy, next to the native sailors, are
the Danes and the Swedes. Normandy, to this day,
furnishes the best for the French service.&mdash;H.</p>

<p class="center">CIVILIZATION.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Mr. Guizot's and Mr. W. von Humboldt's definitions examined.
Its elements.</p></div>


<p>The reader will here pardon me an indispensable
digression. I make use at almost every
moment of a term comprising in its extensive signification
a collection of ideas which it is important
to define accurately: <em>civilization</em>. The greater
or less degree in which this term is applicable to
the social condition of various nations, is my only
standard for the comparative merit of races. I
also speak of a <em>European</em> civilization, in contradistinction
to others of a different character. It
is the more necessary to avoid the least vagueness,
as I am under the disagreeable necessity of differing
from a celebrated writer, who has assumed the
special task of determining the meaning and comprehensiveness
of this expression.</p>

<p>Mr. Guizot, in his <cite>History of Civilization in Modern
Europe</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247">[Pg 247]</a></span> makes use of a term which seems to
me to give rise to a serious confusion of ideas, and
lead to positive errors. He says that civilization
is a <em>fact</em>.</p>

<p>Now, either the word fact must here be understood
in a sense much less strict and precise than
common usage requires, a sense so indistinct&mdash;I
might almost say elastic&mdash;as has never pertained to
it, or what we comprehend under the term civilization
cannot be expressed by the word fact. Civilization
is not <em>a fact</em>; it is a <em>series</em>, a <em>concatenation
of facts</em>, more or less logically united, and resulting
from ideas often sufficiently diverse: ideas and
facts continually reproduce each other. Civilization
is a term applied to a certain state or condition
in which a society exists&mdash;a condition which
is of its own creation, bears its character, and, in
turn, reacts upon it. This condition is of so variable
a nature, that it cannot be called a fact; for a
fact cannot be variable without ceasing to be a
fact. In other words, there is more than one civilization:
there are various kinds. Thus, a civilization
may flourish under every form of government,
and it does not cease to exist when civil commotions
destroy or alter that form.</p>

<p>Let it not be understood that I esteem governmental
forms of little importance. Their choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
is intimately connected with the prosperity of the
society: if judicious, promoting and developing it;
if unpractical, endangering its destruction. But
I speak not here of the temporary prosperity or
misery of a society. I speak of its civilization;
and this is a phenomenon whose causes must be
sought elsewhere, and deeper than in transient
political forms. Its character, its growth, fecundity,
or barrenness, depends upon elementary principles
of far greater importance.</p>

<p>But, in Mr. Guizot's opinion, civilization is a
fact, a unity; and it is of an essentially political
character. Let us see how he defines it. He
has chosen a series of hypotheses, describing society
in various conditions, and then asks if the
state so described is, in the general opinion of
mankind, the state of a people advancing in civilization&mdash;if
it answers to the signification which
mankind generally attaches to this word.<a name="FNanchor-94" id="FNanchor-94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a></p>

<p>"First imagine a people whose outward circumstances
are easy and agreeable; few taxes; few
hardships; justice is fairly administered; in a
word, physical existence, taken altogether, is satisfactorily
and happily regulated. But, with all
this, the moral and intellectual energies of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
people are studiously kept in a state of torpor and
inertness. It can hardly be called oppression; its
tendency is not of that character&mdash;it is rather compression.
We are not without examples of this
state of society. There have been a great number
of little aristocratic republics, in which the people
have been thus treated like a flock of sheep, carefully
tended, physically happy, but without the
least intellectual and moral activity. Is this civilization?
Do we recognize here a people in a state
of moral and social advancement?"</p>

<p>I know not whether such a people is in a state
of advancement, but it certainly may be in a very
advanced state of civilization, else we should find
ourselves compelled to class among the savages
or barbarians all those aristocratic republics of
ancient and modern times, which answer Mr.
Guizot's description. But the common sense of
mankind would never ratify a method which
ejected from within the pale of civilization not only
the Phenicians, Carthaginians, and Laced&aelig;monians,
but even Venice, Genoa, Pisa, the free cities
of Germany&mdash;in fact, all the powerful municipalities
of the last centuries. But, besides this mode
of proceeding being too paradoxical and restrictive,
it seems to me to encounter another difficulty.
Those little aristocratic states, to whom, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of their form of government, Mr. Guizot denies the
aptitude for civilization, have, for the most part,
never been in possession of a special culture peculiar
to themselves. Powerful as many of them
have been, they assimilated, in this respect, with
nations differently governed, but of consanguineous
affinity; they formed a fragment only of a greater
and more general civilization. Thus, the Carthaginians
and Phenicians, though at a great distance
from one another, had a similar mode of culture,
the type of which must be sought in Assyria. The
Italian republics participated in the same ideas and
opinions which developed themselves in the bosom
of neighboring monarchies. The imperial cities
of Thuringia and Suabia, although perfectly independent
in a political point of view, were nevertheless
intimately united with the general progressive
or retrogressive movement of the whole German
race. Mr. Guizot, therefore, by assigning to the
people of different countries degrees of merit proportionate
to the degree and form of their liberty,
creates unjustifiable subdivisions in the same race,
and makes distinctions without a difference. A
lengthy discussion is not in its place here, and I
shall therefore proceed rapidly. If, however, it
were necessary to enter into a controversy, might
we not justly protest against recognizing any inferiority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251">[Pg 251]</a></span>in the case of Genoa, Pisa, Venice, and
others, when compared with countries like Milan,
Naples, or Rome?</p>

<p>Mr. Guizot has himself foreseen this difficulty,
and removed the objection. If he does not recognize
a state of civilization among a people "mildly
governed, but in a state of compression," neither
does he accord this prerogative to another, "whose
outward circumstances are less favorable and agreeable,
although supportable, but whose intellectual
and moral cravings have not been entirely neglected;
among whom pure and elevated sentiments
have been cultivated, and religious and moral
notions reached a certain degree of improvement,
but among whom the desire of liberty has been
stifled; where a certain portion of truth is doled
out to each, but no one permitted to seek for it
himself. This is the condition to which most of
the populations of Asia are sunk, because theocratical
governments there restrain the progress of
mankind; such, for instance, is the state of the
Hindoos."</p>

<p>Thus, besides the aristocratic nations of the
earth, we must moreover exclude from the pale
of civilization the Hindoos, Egyptians, Etruscans,
Peruvians, Thibetans, Japanese&mdash;nay, even modern
Rome and her territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252">[Pg 252]</a></span>I omit the last two hypotheses, because, thanks
to the first two, the state of civilization is already
restricted within boundaries so contracted that
scarce any people on the globe is justified in
pretending to it. A nation, then, can be called
civilized only when it enjoys institutions happily
blending popular liberty and the requisite
strength of authority for maintaining order; when
its progress in material well-being and its moral
development are co-ordinate in a certain manner,
and no other; where religion, as well as government,
is confined within limits accurately defined,
which neither ever transgresses; where each individual
possesses clearly determinate and inalienable
rights. According to this formula, no nation
can be civilized unless its political institutions are
of the constitutional and representative form, and
consequently it is impossible to save many European
nations from the reproach of barbarism.
Then, measuring the <em>degree</em> of civilization by the
perfection of this same and only political form, we
are compelled to place in a second rank all those
constitutional states which have ill employed the
engine of parliament, to reserve the crown exclusively
for those who know how to make good use
of it. By this reasoning, I am forced to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
as truly civilized, in the past as well as the present,
none but the single English nation.<a name="FNanchor-95" id="FNanchor-95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254">[Pg 254]</a></span>I sincerely respect and admire that great people,
whose victories, industry, and universal commerce
<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page255" id="page255">[Pg 255]</a></span>have left no portion of our globe ignorant
of its puissance and the prodigies it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
performed. But still, I do not feel disposed to
respect and admire in the world no other: it
would seem to me too humiliating and cruel to
humanity to confess that, since the beginning of
time, it has never succeeded in producing a civilization
anywhere but upon a small island of the
Western Ocean, has never discovered the laws
and forms which produce this state until the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
of William and Mary. Such a conception of civilization
might seem to many rather a little too
narrow and restrictive. But there is another objection.
If we attach the idea of civilization to a
political form, reason, observation, and science will
soon lose their vote in the decision of the question,
which must thenceforth be left to the passions and
prejudices of parties. There will be some whose
preferences will lead them stoutly to deny that the
institutions of the British Isles are the "perfection
of human reason:" their enthusiasm, perchance,
will be expended in praising the order established
in St. Petersburg or in Vienna. Many, again, and
perhaps the greater number of all living between
the Rhine and the Pyrenees, will sustain to the last
that, notwithstanding a few blemishes, the most
polished, the most civilized country of the world
is <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle France</em>. The moment that the decision
of the degree of intellectual culture becomes a
matter of preference, a question of sentiment, to
come to an understanding is impossible. Each
one will think him the man most advanced in
civilization who shall coincide with his views
about the respective duties of the governing and
the governed; while those who are unfortunate
enough to differ, will be set down as men behind
the age, little better than barbarians, mere "old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
fogies," whose visual organs are too weak for the
dazzling lights of the epoch; or else as daring,
incendiary innovators, who wish to destroy all
established order, and sap the very foundation of
civilization. I think few will differ from me in
considering Mr. Guizot's definition as defective,
and the source from which he derives civilization
as not the real one.</p>

<p>Let us now examine Baron W. Von Humboldt's
definition. "Civilization," says that celebrated
statesman, "is the humanization of nations in their
outward institutions, in their manners, and in the
inward feelings upon which these depend."<a name="FNanchor-96" id="FNanchor-96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a></p>

<p>Here we meet with a defect of the very opposite
kind to that which I took the liberty to point out
in Mr. Guizot's definition. The formula is too
vague, the boundary lines too indistinct. If civilization
consists in a softening of manners, more
than one untutored tribe, some extremely low in
the scale of races, might take precedence over
several European nations whose character contains
more acerbity. There are in the South Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Islands, and elsewhere, very inoffensive populations,
of exceedingly gentle manners, and kind,
accommodating dispositions; yet, though we may
praise them, no one would think of placing them,
in the scale of civilization, above the rough Norwegians,
or even above the ferocious Malays, who,
dressed in brilliant garments of their own fabric,
and upon skilfully constructed vessels of their
own making, traverse the Indian seas, at the same
time the terror and scourge of maritime commerce,
and its most successful votaries. This observation
could not escape so great a mind as William Von
Humboldt's; and he therefore imagines, besides
civilization, a higher degree of development, which
he calls <em>culture</em>, and by which he declares that nations
gain, above their gentle manners, "<em>science and
the arts</em>."<a name="FNanchor-97" id="FNanchor-97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> When the world shall have arrived at
this higher state, it will be peopled by <em>affectionate</em>
and <em>sympathetic</em> beings, very erudite, poetic, and
artistic, but, by reason of this same reunion of
qualities, ignoring the grosser wants of existence:
strangers to the necessity of war, as well as those
of rude mechanical toil.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon the limited leisure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the mass of even those can enjoy whose lot is cast
in the happiest epoch, to abandon themselves to
purely intellectual occupations&mdash;when we consider
how incessant and arduous must ever be the strife
of man with nature and the elements to insure the
mere means of subsistence, it will soon be perceived
that the philosopher of Berlin aimed less
at depicting realities than at drawing from the
domain of abstraction certain entities which appeared
to him beautiful and sublime, and which
are so, indeed, and at causing them to act and
move in a sphere as ideal as themselves. If any
doubts should still remain in this respect, they are
soon dispelled when we arrive at the culminating
point of the system, consisting of a third and last
degree superior to the two others. This greatest
point of perfection is that upon which stands the
<em>finished</em> man (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">der Gebildete</em>); that is to say, the
man who, in his nature, possesses "something
higher and more inward or essential; a clear and
comprehensive faculty of seeing all things in their
true light; a recognition and appreciation of the
ultimate goal of man's moral and intellectual aspirations,
which diffuses itself harmoniously over all
his feelings and his character."<a name="FNanchor-98" id="FNanchor-98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261">[Pg 261]</a></span>We here have a regular gradation from man in
a civilized or "humanized" state, to the man of cultivation&mdash;the
philosopher, the poet, the artist; and
thence still higher to the <em>finished</em>, the <em>perfect</em> man,
who has attained the greatest elevation possible
to our species; a man who, if I seize rightly Mr.
Humboldt's idea, had his living counterpart in
G&oelig;the, as that towering mind is described to us
in its olympic serenity. This theory rests upon
no other basis than Mr. Von Humboldt's perception
of the immense difference between the civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of a nation and the comparative height of perfection
attained by great, isolated individualities. This
difference is so great that civilizations different
from ours, and perhaps inferior to it, have produced
men in some respects superior to those we
admire most.</p>

<p>Upon this point I fully coincide with the great
philosopher whose theory I am unfolding. It is
perfectly correct, that our state of development&mdash;what
we call the European civilization&mdash;produces
neither the profoundest nor the sublimest thinkers,
nor the greatest poets, nor the most skilful artists.
Yet I venture to differ from the illustrious philologist
in believing that to give a practical meaning
to the word civilization, it is necessary to divest
one's self, if but for a moment, from the prejudices
or prepossessions resulting from the examination
of mere details in any particular civilization. We
must take the aggregate result of the whole, and
not make the requisites too few, as in the case of
the man of the first degree, whom I persist in not
acknowledging as civilized merely because his
manners are gentle; nor too many, as in the case
of the sage of the third, for then the development
of human faculties would be limited to a few
individuals, and would produce results purely
isolated and typical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263">[Pg 263]</a></span>The Baron Von Humboldt's system, however,
does honor to that exquisite and generous sensibility,
that grand sublimity which was the dominant
characteristic of this great mind; and in its
purely abstract nature may be compared to the
fragile worlds of Brahmin philosophy. Born from
the brain of a slumbering god, they rise in the air
like the irised bubbles that the child blows from
the suds, bursting and succeeding one another as
the dreams that amuse the celestial sleeper.</p>

<p>But the character of my researches permits me
not to indulge in mere abstractions, however brilliant
and attractive; I must arrive at results tangible
to practical sense and common experience.
I do not wish, like Mr. Guizot, to investigate the
conditions more or less favorable to the prosperity
of societies, nor, like Mr. William Von Humboldt,
to speculate upon the isolated elevation of individual
intelligences; my purpose is to encompass,
if possible, the aggregate power, moral as well as
material, which is developed in great masses of
men. It is not without trepidation that I engage
in a path in which two of the most admired men
of our century have lost themselves; and to avoid
the errors into which they have fallen, I shall
descend to first principles, and define civilization
by first investigating from what causes it results.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
If the reader, then, will follow me patiently and
attentively through the mazes into which I am
forced to enter, I shall endeavor to throw as much
light as I am capable of, upon this inherently obscure
and abstruse subject.</p>

<p>There is no human being so degraded, so
brutish, in whom a twofold instinct, if I may be
permitted so to call it, is not manifest; the instinct
which incites to the gratification of material wants,
and that which leads to higher aspirations. The
degree of intensity of either of these two is the
first and principal measure of the differences
among races. In none, not even in the lowest
tribes, are the two instincts precisely balanced.
Among some, the physical wants or animal propensities
preponderate; in others, these are subordinate
to the speculative tendencies&mdash;the cravings
for the abstract, the supernatural. Thus, the
lowest of the yellow races seem to me to be
dominated rather by the first, the physical instinct,
without, however, being absolutely deprived
of all capacity for abstractions. On the
contrary, among the majority of the black races
of corresponding rank, the habits are less active
than pensive; imagination there attaches greater
value to the things of the invisible than to those
of the visible world. I do not thence deduce any<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
conclusion of superior capacity for civilization on
the part of those latter races over the former, for
history demonstrates that both are equally insusceptible
to attain it. Centuries, thousands of
years, have passed by without either of them
doing aught to ameliorate their condition, because
they have never been able to associate a sufficient
number of ideas with the same number of facts,
to begin the march of progress. I wish merely to
draw attention to the fact, that even among the
lowest races we find this double current differently
constituted. I shall now follow the ascending
scale.</p>

<p>Above the Samoyedes on the one hand, and
the Fidas and Pelagian negroes on the other, we
must place those tribes who are not content with
a mere hut of branches, and a social condition
based upon force only, but who are capable of
comprehending and aspiring to a better condition.
These are one degree above the most barbarous.</p>

<p>If they belong to the first category of races&mdash;those
who act more than they think, among whom
the material tendency predominates over that for
the abstract&mdash;their development will display itself
in a greater perfection of their instruments of
labor, and of war, in a greater care and skill in
their ornaments, etc. In government, the warriors<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
will take precedence over the priests; in their
intercourse with others, they will show a certain
aptitude and readiness for trafficking. Their wars,
though still characterized by cruelty, will originate
rather in a love of gain, than in the mere gratification
of vindictive passions. In one word, material
well-being, physical enjoyments, will be the
main pursuit of each individual. I find this picture
realized among several of the Mongol races,
and also, to some extent, among the Quichuas and
Azmaras of Peru.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if they belong to the second
category&mdash;to those who have a predominating tendency
for the speculative, the abstract&mdash;less care will
be bestowed upon the material interests; the influence
of the priests will preponderate in the government;
in fact, we perceive a complete antithesis to
the condition above described. The Dahomees,
of Western Africa, and the Caffres of the south,
are examples of this state.</p>

<p>Leaving those races whose progressive tendency
is not sufficiently vigorous to enable them to extend
their influence over great multitudes,<a name="FNanchor-99" id="FNanchor-99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> we
come to those of a higher order, in whom this
tendency is so vigorous that they are capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
incorporating, and bringing within their sphere
of action, all those they come in contact with.
They soon ingraft their own social and political
system upon immense multitudes, and impose
upon vast countries the dominion of that combination
of facts and ideas&mdash;more or less co-ordinate&mdash;which
we call a <em>civilization</em>. Among these
races, again, we find the same difference, the same
division, that I already pointed out in those of inferior
merit&mdash;in some the speculative, in others
the more materially active tendency predominates.
It is, indeed, among these races only, that this
difference has important consequences, and is
clearly perceptible. When a tribe, by incorporating
with it great multitudes, has become a people,
has founded a vast dominion, we find that these
two currents or tendencies have augmented in
strength, according to the character of the populations
which enter into the combination, and there
become blended. Whatever tendency prevails
among these populations, they will proportionably
modify the character of the whole. It will be remarked,
moreover, that at different periods of the
life of a people, and in strict accordance with the
mixture of blood and the fusion of different elements,
the oscillation between the two tendencies
becomes more violent, and it may happen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
their relative proportion changes altogether; that
one, at first subordinate, in time becomes predominant.
The results of this mobility are important,
as they influence, in a sensible manner, the
character of a civilization, and its stability.<a name="FNanchor-100" id="FNanchor-100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, I shall distinguish
the two categories of races by designations expressive
of the tendency which predominates in
them, and shall call them accordingly, either <em>speculative</em>
or <em>utilitarian</em>.<a name="FNanchor-101" id="FNanchor-101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> As I have before observed,
these terms imply neither praise nor blame. I use
them merely for convenience, to designate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
leading characteristic, without thereby expressing
a total absence of the other. Thus, the most
utilitarian of the speculative races would closely
approximate to the most speculative of the utilitarian.
At the head of the utilitarian category, as
its type, I place the Chinese; at the head, and as
the type of the other, the Hindoos. Next to the
Chinese I would put the majority of the populations
of ancient Italy, the first Romans of the time
of the republic, and the Germanic tribes. On the
opposite side, among the speculative races, I would
range next to the Hindoos, the Egyptians, and the
nations of the Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>I have said already that the oscillations of the
two principles or tendencies sometimes result in
the preponderance of one, which before was subordinate,
and thus the character of the civilization
is changed. Minor modifications, the history of
almost every people presents. Thus, even the materialistic
utilitarian tendency of the Chinese has been
somewhat modified by their amalgamation with
tribes of another blood, and a different tendency.
In the south, the Yunnan particularly, where this
population prevailed, the inhabitants are much less
exclusively utilitarian than in the north, where
the Chinese element is more pure. If this admixture
of blood operated so slight a change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
genius of that immense nation, that its effects have
ceased, or make themselves perceptible only in an
exceedingly slow manner, it is because its quantity
was so extremely small, compared to the utilitarian
population by which it was absorbed.</p>

<p>Into the actual populations of Europe, the Germanic
tribes infused a strong utilitarian tendency,
and in the north, this has been continually recruited
by new accessions of the same ethnical element;
but in the south (with some exceptions, Piedmont,
and the North of Spain, for example), the Germanic
element forms not so great a portion of the
whole mass, and the utilitarian tendency has there
been overweighed by the opposite genius of the
native populations.</p>

<p>Among the speculative races we have signalized
the Hindoos. They are endowed in a high degree
with the tendency for the supernatural, the abstract.
Their character is more meditative than active and
practical. As their ancient conquests incorporated
with them races of a similar disposition, the utilitarian
element has never prevailed sufficiently to
produce decided results. While, therefore, their
civilization has arrived at a high degree of perfection
in other respects, it has lagged far behind in
all that promotes material comfort, in all that is
strictly useful and practical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Rome, at first strictly utilitarian, changed its
character gradually as the fusion with Greek,
Asiatic, and African elements proceeded, and when
once the ancient utilitarian population was absorbed
in this ethnical inundation, the practical
character of Rome was lost.</p>

<p class="tbreak">From the consideration of these and similar
facts, I arrive at the conclusion, that all intellectual
or moral activity results from the combined action
and mutual reaction of these two tendencies, and
that the social system can arrive at that development
which entitles it to the name of civilization,
only in races which possess, in a high degree,
either of the two, without being too much deficient
in the other.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the examination of other
points also deserving of notice.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Definition of the term&mdash;Specific differences of civilizations&mdash;Hindoo,
Chinese, European, Greek, and Roman civilizations&mdash;Universality

<p>When a tribe, impelled by more vigorous instincts
than its neighbors, succeeds in collecting
the hitherto scattered and isolated fragments into
a compact whole, the first impetus of progress is
thus given, the corner-stone of a civilization laid.
But, to produce great and lasting results, a mere
political preponderance is not sufficient. The
dominant race must know how to lay hold of the
feelings of the masses it has aggregated, to assimilate
their individual interests, and to concentrate
their energies to the same purposes. When the
different elements composing the nation are thus
blended into a more or less homogeneous mass,
certain principles and modes of thinking become<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
general, and form the standard around which all
rally. These principles and modes of thinking,
however, cannot be arbitrarily imposed, and must
be resulting from, and in the main consonant with,
pre-existing sentiments and desires.<a name="FNanchor-102" id="FNanchor-102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> They will
be characterized by a utilitarian or a speculative
tendency, according to the degree in which either
instinct predominates in the constituent elements
of the nation.</p>

<p>This harmony of views and interests is the first
essential to civilization; the second is stability,
and is a natural consequence of the first. The
general principles upon which the political and
social system rests, being based upon instincts
common to all, are by all regarded with the most
affectionate veneration, and firmly believed to be
perpetual. The purer a race remains, the more
conservative will it be in its institutions, for its
instincts never change. But the admixture of
foreign blood produces proportionate modifications
in the national ideas. The new-comers
introduce instincts and notions which were
not calculated upon in the social edifice. Alterations
therefore become necessary, and these are
often wholesome, especially in the youthful period<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of the society, when the new ethnical elements
have not as yet acquired an undue preponderance.
But, as the empire increases, and comprises elements
more and more heterogeneous, the changes
become more radical, and are not always for the
better. Finally, as the initiatory and conservative
element disappears, the different parts of the nation
are no longer united by common instincts
and interests; the original institutions are not
adapted to their wants; sudden and total transformations
become common, and a vain phantom of
stability is pursued through endless experiments.
But, while thus vacillating betwixt conflicting interests,
and changing its purpose every hour, the
nation imagines itself advancing to some imaginary
goal of perfection. Firmly convinced of its own
perpetuity, it holds fast to the doctrine which its
daily acts disprove, that one of the principal features
of a civilization is God-like immutability.
And though each day brings forth new discontents
and new changes equally futile, the apprehensions
of the day are quieted with the expectations of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>I have said that the conditions necessary for the
development of a civilization are&mdash;the aggregation
of large masses, and stable institutions resulting
from common views and interests. The sociable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
inclinations of man, and the less noble attributes
of his nature, perform the rest. While the former
bring him in intimate and varied connections with
his fellow-men, the latter give rise to continual
contests and emulation. In a large community, a
strong fist is no longer sufficient to insure protection
and give distinction, and the resources of the
mind are applied and developed. Intellect continually
seeks and finds new fields for exertion,
either in the regions of the abstract, or in the
material world. By its productions in either, we
recognize an advanced state of society. The most
common source of error in judging foreign nations,
is that we are apt to look merely at the exterior
demonstrations of their civilization, and because,
in this respect, their civilization does not resemble
ours, we hastily conclude that they are barbarous,
or, at least, greatly inferior to us. A conclusion,
drawn from such premises, must needs be very
superficial, and therefore ought to be received with
caution.</p>

<p>I believe myself now prepared to express my
idea of a civilization, by defining it as</p>

<p><em>A state of comparative stability, in which a large
collection of individuals strive, by peaceful means, to
satisfy their wants, and refine their intelligence and
manners.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276">[Pg 276]</a></span>This definition includes, without exception, all
the nations which I have mentioned as being civilized.
But, as these nations have few points of resemblance,
the question suggests itself: Do not, then,
all civilizations tend to the same results? I think
not; for, as the nations called to the noble task of
accomplishing a civilization, are endowed with the
utilitarian and speculative tendencies in various
degrees and proportions, their paths must necessarily
lie in very divergent directions.</p>

<p>What are the material wants of the Hindoo?
Rice and butter for his nourishment, and a piece
of cotton cloth for his garment. Nor can this
abstemiousness be accounted for by climate, for
the native of Thibet, under a much more rigorous
sky, displays the same quality. In these peoples,
the imaginative faculty greatly predominates, their
intellectual efforts are directed to abstractions, and
the fruits of their civilization are therefore seldom
of a practical or utilitarian character. Magnificent
temples are hewn out of mountains of solid rock
at an expense of labor and time that terrifies the
imagination; gigantic constructions are erected;&mdash;all
this in honor of the gods, while nothing is
done for man's benefit, unless it be tombs. By
the side of the miracles wrought by the sculptor's
chisel, we admire the finished masterpieces of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
literature full of vigor, and as ingenious and subtle
in theology and metaphysics, as beautiful in its
variety: in speculative efforts, human thought descends
without trepidation to immeasurable depths;
its lyric poetry challenges the admiration of all
mankind.</p>

<p>But if we leave the domain of idealistic reveries,
and seek for inventions of practical utility, and
for the sciences that are their theoretical basis, we
find a deplorable deficiency. From a dazzling
height, we suddenly find ourselves descended to a
profound and darksome abyss. Useful inventions
are scarce, of a petty character, and, being neglected,
remain barren of results. While the Chinese observed
and invented a great deal, the Hindoos invented
but little, and of that little took no care;
the Greeks, also, have left us much information,
but little worthy of their genius; and the Romans,
once arrived at the culminating point of their
history, could no longer make any real progress,
for the Asiatic admixture in which they were absorbed
with surprising rapidity, produced a population
incapable of the patient and toilsome investigation
of stern realities. Their administrative
genius, however, their legislation, and the useful
monuments with which they provided the soil of
their territories, attest sufficiently the practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
character which, at one time, so eminently characterized
that people; and prove that if the
South of Europe had not been so rapidly submerged
with colonists from Asia and the North of
Africa, positive science would have been the
gainer, and less would have been left to be accomplished
by the Germanic races, which afterward
gave it a renewed impulse.</p>

<p>The Germanic conquerors of the fifth century
were characterized by instincts of a similar kind
to those of the Chinese, but of a higher order.
While they possessed the utilitarian tendency as
strongly, if not stronger, they had, at the same
time, a much greater endowment of the speculative.
Their disposition presented a happy blending
of these two mainsprings of activity. Where-ever
the Teutonic blood predominates, the utilitarian
tendency, ennobled and refined by the
speculative, is unmistakable. In England, North
America, and Holland, this tendency governs and
preponderates over all the other national instincts.
It is so, in a lesser degree, in Belgium, and even
in the North of France, where everything susceptible
of practical application is understood with
marvellous facility. But as we advance further
south, this predisposition is less apparent, and,
finally, disappears altogether. We cannot attribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279">[Pg 279]</a></span>this to the action of the sun, for the
Piedmontese live in a much warmer climate than
the Proven&ccedil;als and the inhabitants of the Languedoc;
it is the effect of blood.</p>

<p>The series of speculative races, or those rendered
so by admixture, occupies the greater portion
of the globe, and this observation is particularly
applicable to Europe. With the exception of the
Teutonic family, and a portion of the Sclavonic,
all other groups of our part of the world are but
slightly endowed with the faculty for the useful
and practical; or, having already acted their part
in the world's history, will not be able to recommence
it. All these races, from the Gaul to the
Celtiberian, and thence to the variegated compounds
of the Italian populations, present a descending
scale from a utilitarian point of view.
Not that they are devoid of all the aptitudes of
that tendency, but they are wanting in some of
the most essential.</p>

<p>The union of the Germanic tribes with the
races of the ancient world, this engrafting of a
vigorous utilitarian principle upon the ideas of
that variegated compound, produced our civilization;
the richness, diversity, and fecundity of our
state of culture is the natural result of that combination
of so many different elements, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
each contributed their part, and which the practical
vigor of our Germanic ancestors, succeeded in
blending into a more or less harmonious whole.</p>

<p>Wherever our state of civilization extends, it is
characterized by two traits; the first, that the
population contains a greater or less admixture of
Teutonic blood; the other, that it is Christian.
This last feature, however, as I said before, though
the most obvious and striking, is by no means
essential, because many nations are Christian, and
many more may become so, without participating
in our civilization. But the first feature is positive,
decisive. Wherever the Germanic element
has not penetrated, our civilization cannot flourish.<a name="FNanchor-103" id="FNanchor-103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281">[Pg 281]</a></span>This leads me to the investigation of a serious
and important question: "Can it be asserted that
all the European nations are really and thoroughly
civilized?" Do the ideas and facts which rise
upon the surface of our civilization, strike root
in the basis of our social and political structure,
and derive their vitality from that source? Are
the results of these ideas and facts such as are
conformable to the instincts, the tendencies, of the
masses? Or, in other words, have the lowest strata
of our populations the same direction of thought
and action as the highest&mdash;that direction which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
may call the spirit or genius of our progressive
movement?</p>

<p>To arrive at a true and unbiassed solution of
this question, let us examine other civilizations,
different from ours, and then institute a comparison.</p>

<p>The similarity of views and ideas, the unity of
purpose, which characterized the whole body of
citizens in the Grecian states, during the brilliant
period of their history, has been justly admired.
Upon every essential point, the opinions of every
individual, though often conflicting, were, nevertheless,
derived from the same source, emanated
from the same general views and sentiments; individuals
might differ in politics, one wishing a more
oligarchical, another a more democratic government;
or they might differ in religion, one worshipping,
by preference, the Eleusinian Ceres, another
the Minerva of the Parthenon; or in matters of
taste, one might prefer &AElig;schylus to Sophocles,
Alceus to Pindar. At the bottom, the disputants
all participated in the same views and ideas, ideas
which might well be called national. The question
was one of degree, not of kind.<a name="FNanchor-104" id="FNanchor-104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Rome, previous to the Punic wars, presented
the same spectacle; the civilization of the country
was uniform, and embraced all, from the master to
the slave.<a name="FNanchor-105" id="FNanchor-105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> All might not participate in it to the
same extent, but all participated in it and in no
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284">[Pg 284]</a></span>But in Rome, after the Punic wars, and in Greece,
soon after Pericles, and especially after Philip of
Macedon, this character of homogeneity began to
disappear. The greater mixture of nations produced
a corresponding mixture of civilizations,
and the compound thus formed exceeded in variety,
elegance, refinement, and learning, the ancient
mode of culture. But it had this capital inconvenience,
both in Hellas and in Italy, that it belonged
exclusively to the higher classes. Its nature, its
merits, its tendencies, were ignored by the sub-strata
of the population. Let us take the civilization
of Rome after the Asiatic wars. It was a grand,
magnificent monument of human genius. It had a
cosmopolitan character: the rhetoricians of Greece
contributed to it the transcendental spirit, the
jurists and publicists of Syria and Alexandria
gave it a code of atheistic, levelling, and monarchical
laws&mdash;each part of the empire furnished to the
common store some portion of its ideas, its sciences,
and its character. But whom did this civilization
embrace? The men engaged in the public administration
or in great monetary enterprises, the people
of wealth and of leisure. It was merely submitted
to, not adopted by the masses. The populations
of Europe understood nothing of those Asiatic and
African contributions to the civilization; the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285">[Pg 285]</a></span>of Egypt, Numidia, or Asia, were equally
uninterested in what came from Gaul and Spain,
countries with which they had nothing in common.
But a small minority of the Roman people stood
on the pinnacle, and being in possession of the
secret, valued it. The rest, those not included in
the aristocracy of wealth and position, preserved
the civilization peculiar to the land of their birth,
or, perhaps, had none at all. Here, then, we have
an example of a great and highly perfected civilization,
dominating over untold millions, but
founding its reign not in their desires or convictions,
but in their exhaustion, their weakness, their
listlessness.</p>

<p>A very different spectacle is presented in China.
The boundless extent of that empire includes, indeed,
several races markedly distinct, but I shall
speak at present only of the national race, the
Chinese proper. One spirit animates the whole of
this immense multitude, which is counted by hundreds
of millions. Whatever we think of their
civilization, whether we admire or censure the
principles upon which it is based, the results which
it has produced, and the direction which it takes;
we cannot deny that it pervades all ranks, that
every individual takes in it a definite and intelligent
part. And this is not because the country is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
free, in our sense of the word: there is no democratic
principle which secures, by law, to every
one the position which his efforts may attain, and
thus spurs him on to exertions. No; I discard
all Utopian pictures. The peasant and the man of
the middle classes, in the Celestial Empire, are no
better assured of rising by their own merit only,
than they are elsewhere. It is true that, in theory,
public honors are solely the reward of merit, and
every one is permitted to offer himself as a candidate;<a name="FNanchor-106" id="FNanchor-106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a>
but it is well known that, in reality, the
families of great functionaries monopolize all
lucrative offices, and that the scholastic diplomas
often cost more money than efforts of study. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
disappointed or hopeless ambition never leads the
possessor to imagine a different system; the aim
of the reformer is to remedy the abuses of the
established organization, not to substitute another.
The masses may groan under ills and abuses, but
the fault is charged, not to the social and political
system, which to them is an object of unqualified
admiration, but to the persons to whose care the performance
of its duties is committed. The head of
the government, or his functionaries, may become
unpopular, but the form itself, the government,
never. A very remarkable feature of the Chinese
is that among them primary instruction is so
universal; it reaches classes whom we hardly
imagine to have any need of it. The cheapness
of books, the immense number and low price of
the schools, enable even the poorest to acquire the
elements of knowledge, reading and writing.<a name="FNanchor-107" id="FNanchor-107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
laws, their spirit and tendency, are well known
and understood by all classes, and the government
prides itself upon facilitating the study of this useful
science.<a name="FNanchor-108" id="FNanchor-108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> The instinct of the masses is decidedly
averse to all political convulsions. Mr. Davis, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
was commissioner of H. B. Majesty in China, and
who studied its affairs with the assiduity of a man
who is interested in understanding them well, says
that the character of the people cannot be better
expressed than by calling them "a nation of steady
conservatives."<a name="FNanchor-109" id="FNanchor-109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have a most striking contrast to
the civilization of Rome in her latter days, when
governmental changes occurred in fearfully rapid
succession, until the arrival of the nations of the
north. In every portion of that vast empire, there
were whole populations that had no interest in the
preservation of established order, and were ever
ready to second the maddest schemes, to embark in
any enterprise that seemed to promise advantage,
or that was represented in seductive colors by some
ambitious demagogue. During that long period
of several centuries, no scheme was left untried:
property, religion, the sanctity of family relations,
were all called in question, and innovators in
every portion of the empire, found multitudes
ever disposed to carry their theories into practice
by force. Nothing in the Greco-Roman world
rested on a solid basis, not even the imperial
unity, so indispensable, it would seem, to the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
self-preservation of such a state of society. It
was not only the armies, with their swarm of
<i>improvisto</i> C&aelig;sars, that undertook the task of
shaking this palladium of national safety; the emperors
themselves, beginning with Diocletian, had
so little faith in monarchy, that they willingly made
the experiment of dualism in the government,
and finally found four at a time not too many for
governing the empire.<a name="FNanchor-110" id="FNanchor-110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> I repeat it, not one institution,
not one principle, was stable in that
wretched state of society, which continued to preserve
some outward form, merely from the physical
impossibility of assuming any others, until the
men of the north came to assist in its demolition.</p>

<p>Between these two great societies, then, the Roman
empire, and that of China, we perceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
most complete contrast. By the side of the civilization
of Eastern Asia, I may mention that of
India, Thibet, and other portions of Central Asia,
which is equally universal, and diffused among
all ranks and classes. As in China there is a certain
level of information to which all attain, so in
Hindostan, every one is animated by the same
spirit; each individual knows precisely what his
caste requires him to learn, to think, to believe.
Among the Buddhists of Thibet, and the table-lands
of Asia, nothing is rarer than to find a peasant
who cannot read, and there everybody has the
same convictions upon important subjects.</p>

<p>Do we find this homogeneity in European nations?
It is scarce worth while to put the question.
Not even the Greco-Roman empire presents incongruities
so strange, or contrasts so striking, as are
to be found among us; not only among the
various nationalities of Europe, but in the bosom
of the same sovereignty. I shall not speak of
Russia, and the states that form the Austrian
empire; the demonstration of my position would
there be too facile. Let us turn to Germany; to
Italy, Southern Italy in particular; to Spain, which,
though in a less degree, presents a similar picture;
or to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292">[Pg 292]</a></span>I select France. The difference of manners, in
various parts of this country, has struck even the
most superficial observer, and it has long since
been observed that Paris is separated from the
rest of France by a line of demarcation so decided
and accurately defined, that at the very gates of
the capital, a nation is found, utterly different from
that within the walls. Nothing can be more true:
those who attach to our political unity the idea of
similarity of thoughts, of character&mdash;in fine, of
nationality, are laboring under a great delusion.
There is not one principle that governs society
and is connected with our civilization, which is
understood in the same manner in all our departments.
I do not speak here merely of the
peculiarities that characterize the native of Normandy,
of Brittany, Angevin, Limousin, Gascony,
Provence. Every one knows how little alike
these various populations are,<a name="FNanchor-111" id="FNanchor-111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a> and how they differ
in their tendencies and modes of thinking. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
wish to draw attention to the fact, that while in
China, Thibet, India, the most essential ideas upon
which the civilization is based, are common to all
classes, participated in by all, it is by no means
so among us. The very rudiments of our knowledge,
the most elementary and most generally accessible
portion of it, remain an impenetrable mystery
to our rural populations, among whom but
few individuals are found acquainted with reading
and writing. This is not for want of opportunities&mdash;it
is because no value is attached to these
acquisitions, because their utility is not perceived.
I speak from my own observation, and that of
persons who had ample facilities, and brought
extensive information and great judgment to the
task of investigation. Government has made the
most praiseworthy efforts to remedy the evil, to
raise the peasantry from the sink of ignorance in
which they vegetate. But the wisest laws, and
the most carefully calculated institutions have
proved abortive. The smallest village affords
ample opportunities for common education; even
the adult, when conscription forces him into the
army, finds in the regimental schools every facility
for acquiring the most necessary branches of
knowledge. Compulsion is resorted to&mdash;every one
who has lived in the provinces knows with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
success. Parents send their children to school
with undisguised repugnance, for they regret the
time thus spent as wasted, and, therefore, eagerly
seize the most trifling pretext for withdrawing
them, and never suffer them to exceed the legal
term of attendance. So soon as the young man
leaves school, or the soldier has served his time,
they hasten to forget what they were compelled to
learn, and what they are heartily ashamed of.
They return forever after to the local <i>patois</i><a name="FNanchor-112" id="FNanchor-112"></a><a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a> of
their birthplace, and pretend to have forgotten
the French language, which, indeed, is but too
often true. It is a painful conclusion, but one
which many and careful observations have forced
upon me, that all the generous private and public
endeavors to instruct our rural population, are absolutely
futile, and can tend no further than to
enforce an outward compliance. They care not for
the knowledge we wish to give them&mdash;they will
not have it, and this not from mere negligence or
apathy, but from a feeling of positive hostility to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
our civilization. This is a startling assertion, but
I have not yet adduced all the proofs in support of
it.</p>

<p>In those parts of the country where the laboring
classes are employed in manufactures principally,
and in the great cities, the workmen are
easily induced to learn to read and write. The
circumstances with which they are surrounded,
leave them no doubt as to the practical advantages
accruing to them from these acquisitions. But so
soon as these men have sufficiently mastered the
first elements of knowledge, to what use do they,
for the most part, apply them? To imbibe or
give vent to ideas and sentiments the most subversive
of all social order. The instinctive, but
passive hostility to our civilization, is superseded
by a bitter and active enmity, often productive
of the most fearful calamities. It is among
these classes that the projectors of the wildest,
most incendiary schemes readily recruit their
partisans; that the advocates of socialism, community
of goods and wives, all, in fact, who, under
the pretext of removing the ills and abuses that
afflict the social system, propose to tear it down,
find ready listeners and zealous believers.</p>

<p>There are, however, portions of the country to
which this picture does not apply; and these exceptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296">[Pg 296]</a></span>furnish me with another proof in favor of
my proposition. Among the agricultural and
manufacturing populations of the north and northeast,
information is general; it is readily received,
and, once received, retained and productive of
good fruits. These people are intelligent, well-informed,
and orderly, like their neighbors in Belgium
and the whole of the Netherlands. And
these, also, are the populations most closely akin
to the Teutonic race, the race which, as I said in
another place, gave the initiative to our civilization.</p>

<p>The aversion to our civilization, of which I spoke,
is not the only singular feature in the character of
our rural populations. If we penetrate into the privacy
of their thoughts and beliefs, we make discoveries
equally striking and startling. The bishops
and parish clergy have to this day, as they had one,
five, or fifteen centuries ago, to battle with mysterious
superstitions, or hereditary tendencies, some
of which are the more formidable as they are seldom
openly avowed, and can, therefore, be neither
attacked nor conquered. There is no enlightened
priest, that has the care of his flock at heart, but
knows from experience with what deep cunning
the peasant, however devout, knows how to conceal
in his own bosom some fondly cherished traditional
idea or belief, which reveals itself only at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
long intervals, and without his knowledge. If he
is spoken to about it, he denies or evades the discussion,
but remains unshaken in his convictions.
He has unbounded confidence in his pastor, unbounded
except upon this one subject, that might
not inappropriately be called his secret religion.
Hence that taciturnity and reserve which, in all
our provinces, is the most marked characteristic
of the peasant, and which he never for a moment
lays aside towards the class he calls <em>bourgeois</em>; that
impassable barrier between him and even the most
popular and well-intentioned landed proprietor of
his district.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that this results merely
from rudeness and ignorance. Were it so,
we might console ourselves with the hope that
they will gradually improve and assimilate with
the more enlightened classes. But these people
are precisely like certain savages; at a superficial
glance they appear unreflecting and brutish,
because their exterior is humble, and their
character requires to be studied. But so soon as
we penetrate, however little, into their own circle
of ideas, the feelings that govern their private
life, we discover that in their obstinate isolation
from our civilization, they are not actuated by a
feeling of degradation. Their affections and antipathies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298">[Pg 298]</a></span>do not arise from mere accidental circumstances,
but, on the contrary, are in accordance
with logical reasoning based upon well-defined
and clearly conceived ideas.<a name="FNanchor-113" id="FNanchor-113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> In speaking of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
religious notions awhile ago, I should have remarked
what an immense distance there is between
our doctrines of morals and those of the peasantry,
how widely different are their ideas from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
which we attach to the same word.<a name="FNanchor-114" id="FNanchor-114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> With what
pertinacious obstinacy they continue to look upon
every one not peasant like themselves, as the people
of remote antiquity looked upon a foreigner.
It is true they do not kill him, thanks to the singular
and mysterious terror which the laws, in the
making of which they have no part, inspire them;
but they hate him cordially, distrust him, and if
they can do so without too great a risk, fleece him
without scruple and with immense satisfaction.
Yet they are not wicked or ill-disposed. Among
themselves they are kind-hearted, charitable, and
obliging. But then they regard themselves as a
distinct race&mdash;a race, they tell you&mdash;that is weak,
oppressed, and that must resort to cunning and
stratagem to gain their due, but which, nevertheless,
preserves its pride and contempt for all others.
In many of our provinces, the laborer believes
himself of much better stock than his former lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
or present employer. The family pride of many
of our peasants is, to say the least, as great as that
of the nobility during the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor-115" id="FNanchor-115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that the lower strata of
the population of France have few features in
common with the higher. Our civilization penetrates
but little below the surface. The great
mass is indifferent&mdash;nay, positively hostile to it.
The most tragic events have stained the country
with torrents of blood, unparalleled convulsions
have destroyed every ancient fabric, both social
and political. Yet the agricultural populations
have never been roused from their apathetic indifference,<a name="FNanchor-116" id="FNanchor-116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a>
have never taken any other part but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to which they were forced. When their own personal
and immediate interests were not at stake,
they allowed the tempests to blow by without concern,
without even passive sympathy on one side
or the other. Many persons, frightened and scandalized
at this spectacle, have declared the peasantry
as irreclaimably perverse. This is at the
same time an injustice, and a very false appreciation
of their character. The peasants regard us
almost as their enemies. They comprehend nothing
of our civilization, contribute nothing to it
of their own accord, and they think themselves
authorized to profit by its disasters, whenever they
can. Apart from this antagonism, which sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303">[Pg 303]</a></span>displays itself in an active, but oftener in a
passive manner, it cannot be doubted that they
possess moral qualities of a high order, though
often singularly applied.</p>

<p>Such is the state of civilization in France. It
may be asserted that of a population of thirty-six
millions, ten participate in the ideas and mode of
thinking upon which our civilization is based,
while the remaining twenty-six altogether ignore
them, are indifferent and even hostile to them, and
this computation would, I think, be even more
flattering than the real truth. Nor is France an
exception in this respect. The picture I have
given applies to the greater part of Europe. Our
civilization is suspended, as it were, over an unfathomable
gulf, at the bottom of which there slumber
elements which may, one day, be roused and
prove fearfully, irresistibly destructive. This is
an awful, an ominous truth. Upon its ultimate
consequences it is painful to reflect. Wisdom
may, perhaps, foresee the storm, but can do little
to avert it.</p>

<p>But ignored, despised, or hated as it is by the
greater number of those over whom it extends its
dominion, our civilization is, nevertheless, one of
the grandest, most glorious monuments of the
human mind. In the inventive, initiatory quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
it does not surpass, or even equal some of its predecessors,
but in comprehensiveness it surpasses all.
From this comprehensiveness arise its powers of
appropriation, of conquest; for, to comprehend is
to seize, to possess. It has appropriated all their
acquisitions, and has remodelled, reconstructed
them. It did not create the exact sciences, but it
has given them their exactitude, and has disembarrassed
them from the divagations from which,
by a singular paradox, they were anciently less
free than any other branch of knowledge. Thanks
to its discoveries, the material world is better
known than at any other epoch. The laws by
which nature is governed, it has, in a great measure,
succeeded in unveiling, and it has applied
them so as to produce results truly wonderful.
Gradually, and by the clearness and correctness of
its induction, it has reconstructed immense fragments
of history, of which the ancients had no
knowledge; and as it recedes from the primitive
ages of the world, it penetrates further into the
mist that obscures them. These are great points
of superiority, and which cannot be contested.</p>

<p>But these being admitted, are we authorized to
conclude&mdash;as is so generally assumed as a matter
of course&mdash;that the characteristics of our civilization
are such as to entitle it to the pre-eminence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
among all others? Let us examine what are its
peculiar excellencies. Thanks to the prodigious
number of various elements that contributed to
its formation, it has an eclectic character which
none of its predecessors or contemporaries possess.
It unites and combines so many various qualities
and faculties, that its progress is equally facile
in all directions; and it has powers of analysis
and generalization so great, that it can embrace
and appropriate all things, and, what is more,
apply them to practical purposes. In other words,
it advances at once in a number of different directions,
and makes valuable conquests in all, but it
cannot be said that it advances at the same time
<em>furthest</em> in all. Variety, perhaps, rather than great
intensity, is its characteristic. If we compare its
progress in any one direction with what has been
done by others in the same, we shall find that in
few, indeed, can our civilization claim pre-eminence.
I shall select three of the most striking
features of every civilization; the art of government,
the state of the fine arts, and refinement of
manners.</p>

<p>In the art of government, the civilization of
Europe has arrived at no positive result. In this
respect, it has been unable to assume a definite
character. It has laid down no principles. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
every country over which its dominion extends, it
is subservient to the exigencies of the various
races which it has aggregated, but not united. In
England, Holland, Naples, and Russia, political
forms are still in a state of comparative stability,
because either the whole population, or the dominant
portion of it, is composed of the same or
homogeneous elements. But everywhere else,
especially in France, Central Italy, and Germany,
where the ethnical diversity is boundless, governmental
theories have never risen to the dignity of
recognized truth; political science consisted in an
endless series of experiments. Our civilization,
therefore, being unable to assume a definite political
feature, is devoid, in this respect, of that stability
which I comprised as an essential feature in
my definition of a civilization. This impotency
is not found in many other civilizations which we
deem inferior. In the Celestial Empire, in the
Buddhistic and Brahminical societies, the political
feature of the civilization is clearly enounced, and
clearly understood by each individual member.
In matters of politics all think alike; under a wise
administration, when the secular institutions produce
beneficent fruits, all rejoice; when in unskilled
or malignant hands, they endanger the
public welfare, it is a misfortune to be regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
as we regret our own faults; but no circumstance
can abate the respect and admiration with which
they are regarded. It may be desirable to correct
abuses that have crept into them, but never to replace
them by others. It cannot be denied that
these civilizations, therefore, whatever we may
think of them in other respects, enjoy a guarantee
of durability, of longevity, in which ours is sadly
wanting.</p>

<p>With regard to the arts, our civilization is decidedly
inferior to others. Whether we aim at
the grand or the beautiful, we cannot rival either
the imposing grandeur of the civilization of Egypt,
of India, or even of the ancient American empires,
nor the elegant beauty of that of Greece. Centuries
hence&mdash;when the span of time allotted to us
shall have been consumed, when our civilization,
like all that preceded it, shall have sunk in the
dim shades of the past, and have become a matter
of inquiry only to the historical student&mdash;some
future traveller may wander among the forests and
marshes on the banks of the Thames, the Seine,
or the Rhine, but he will find no glorious monuments
of our grandeur; no sumptuous or gigantic
ruins like those of Phil&aelig;, of Nineveh, of Athens, of
Salsetta, or of Tenochtitlan. A remote posterity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
may venerate our memory as their preceptors in
exact sciences. They may admire our ingenuity,
our patience, the perfection to which we have carried
inductive reasoning&mdash;not so our conquests in
the regions of the abstract. In poesy we can bequeath
them nothing. The boundless admiration
which we bestow upon the productions of foreign
civilizations both past and present, is a positive
proof of our own inferiority in this respect.<a name="FNanchor-117" id="FNanchor-117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309">[Pg 309]</a></span>Perhaps the most striking features of a civilization,
though not a true standard of its merit, is
the degree of refinement which it has attained.
By refinement I mean all the luxuries and amenities
of life, the regulations of social intercourse,
delicacy of habits and tastes. It cannot be denied
that in all these we do not surpass, nor even equal,
many former as well as contemporaneous civilizations.
We cannot rival the magnificence of the
latter days of Rome, or of the Byzantine empire;
we can but imagine the gorgeous luxury of Eastern
civilizations; and in our own past history we
find periods when the modes of living were more
sumptuous, polished intercourse regulated by a
higher and more exacting standard, when taste
was more cultivated, and habits more refined. It
is true, that we are amply compensated by a
greater and more general diffusion of the comforts
of life; but in its exterior manifestations, our civilization
compares unfavorably with many others,
and might almost be called shabby.</p>

<p class="tbreak">Before concluding this digression upon civilization,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310">[Pg 310]</a></span>which has already extended perhaps too far,
it may not be unnecessary to reiterate the principal
ideas which I wished to present to the mind
of the reader. I have endeavored to show that
every civilization derives its peculiar character
from the race which gave the initiatory impulse.
The alteration of this initiatory principle produces
corresponding modifications, and even total changes,
in the character of the civilization. Thus our
civilization owes its origin to the Teutonic race,
whose leading characteristic was an elevated utilitarianism.
But as these races ingrafted their mode
of culture upon stocks essentially different, the
character of the civilization has been variously
modified according to the elements which it combined
and amalgamated. The civilization of a
nation, therefore, exhibits the kind and degree of
their capabilities. It is the mirror in which they
reflect their individuality.</p>

<p>I shall now return to the natural order of my
deductions, the series of which is yet far from
being complete. I commenced by enouncing the
truth that the existence and annihilation of human
societies depended upon immutable and uniform
laws. I have proved the insufficiency of adventitious
circumstances to produce these phenomena,
and have traced their causes to the various capabilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311">[Pg 311]</a></span>of different human groups; in other
words, to the moral and intellectual diversity of
races. Logic, then, demands that I should determine
the meaning and bearing of the word race,
and this will be the object of the next chapter.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to determine first the physiological
bearing of the word <em>race</em>.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many scientific observers, who
judge from the first impression, and take extremes<a name="FNanchor-118" id="FNanchor-118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a>
as the basis of their reasoning, the groups of the
human family are distinguished by differences so
radical and essential, that it is impossible to believe
them all derived from the same stock. They,
therefore, suppose several other genealogies besides
that of Adam and Eve. According to this doctrine,
instead of but one species in the genus <i>homo</i>,
there would be three, four, or even more, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
distinct ones, whose commingling would produce
what the naturalists call <em>hybrids</em>.</p>

<p>General conviction is easily secured in favor of
this theory, by placing before the eyes of the observer
instances of obvious and striking dissimilarities
among the various groups. The critic who
has before him a human subject with a skin of
olive-yellow; black, straight, and thin hair; little,
if any beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes; a broad
and flattened face, with features not very distinct;
the space between the eyes broad and flat; the
orbits large and open; the nose flattened; the
cheeks high and prominent; the opening of the
eyelids narrow, linear, and oblique, the inner angle
the lowest; the ears and lips large; the forehead
low and slanting, allowing a considerable portion
of the face to be seen when viewed from above;
the head of somewhat a pyramidal form; the limbs
clumsy; the stature humble; the whole conformation
betraying a marked tendency to obesity:<a name="FNanchor-119" id="FNanchor-119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> the
critic who examines this specimen of humanity,
at once recognizes a well characterized and clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
defined type, the principal features of which will
readily be imprinted in his memory.</p>

<p>Let us suppose him now to examine another individual:
a negro, from the western coast of
Africa. This specimen is of large size, and vigorous
appearance. The color is a jetty black, the
hair crisp, generally called <em>woolly</em>; the eyes are
prominent, and the orbits large; the nose thick,
flat, and confounded with the prominent cheeks;
the lips very thick and everted; the jaws projecting,
and the chin receding; the skull assuming
the form called prognathous. The low forehead
and muzzle-like elongation of the jaws, give to
the whole being an almost animal appearance,
which is heightened by the large and powerful
lower-jaw, the ample provision for muscular insertions,
the greater size of cavities destined for the
reception of the organs of smell and sight, the
length of the forearm compared with the arm, the
narrow and tapering fingers, etc. "In the negro,
the bones of the leg are bent outwards; the tibia
and fibula are more convex in front than in the
European; the calves of the legs are very high,
so as to encroach upon the hams; the feet and
hand, but particularly the former, are flat; the os
calcis, instead of being arched, is continued nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
in a straight line with the other bones of the foot,
which is remarkably broad."<a name="FNanchor-120" id="FNanchor-120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a></p>

<p>In contemplating a human being so formed, we
are involuntarily reminded of the structure of the
ape, and we feel almost inclined to admit that the
tribes of Western Africa are descended from a
stock which bears but a slight and general resemblance
to that of the Mongolian family.</p>

<p>But there are some groups, whose aspect is even
less flattering to the self-love of humanity than
that of the Congo. It is the peculiar distinction
of Oceanica to furnish about the most degraded
and repulsive of those wretched beings, who seem
to occupy a sort of intermediate station between
man and the mere brute. Many of the groups of
that latest-discovered world, by the excessive leanness
and starveling development of their limbs;<a name="FNanchor-121" id="FNanchor-121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a>
the disproportionate size of their heads; the excessive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316">[Pg 316]</a></span>hopeless stupidity stamped upon their
countenances; present an aspect so hideous and
disgusting, that&mdash;contrasted with them&mdash;even the
negro of Western Africa gains in our estimation,
and seems to claim a less ignoble descent than
they.</p>

<p>We are still more tempted to adopt the conclusions
of the advocates for the plurality of species,
when, after having examined types taken from
every quarter of the globe, we return to the inhabitants
of Europe and Southern and Western
Asia. How vast a superiority these exhibit in
beauty, correctness of proportion, and regularity
of features! It is they who enjoy the honor of
having furnished the living models for the unrivalled
masterpieces of ancient sculpture. But
even among these races there has existed, since the
remotest times, a gradation of beauty, at the head
of which the European may justly be placed, as
well for symmetry of limbs as for vigorous muscular
development. Nothing, then, would appear
more reasonable than to pronounce the different
types of mankind as foreign to each other as are
animals of different species.</p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the conclusion arrived at by
those who first systematized their observations, and
attempted to establish a classification; and so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
as this classification depended upon general facts,
it seemed incontestable.</p>

<p><cite>Camper</cite> took the lead. He was not content
with deciding upon merely superficial appearances,
but wished to rest his demonstrations upon a
mathematical basis, by defining, anatomically, the
distinguishing characteristics of different types.
If he succeeded in this, he would thereby establish
a strict and logical method of treating the subject,
preclude all doubt, and give to his opinions that
rigorous precision without which there is no true
science. I borrow from Mr. Prichard,<a name="FNanchor-122" id="FNanchor-122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> Camper's
own account of his method. "The basis on which
the distinction of nations<a name="FNanchor-123" id="FNanchor-123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> is founded, says he, may
be displayed by two straight lines; one of which
is to be drawn through the <i>meatus auditorius</i> (the
external entrance of the ear) to the base of the
nose; and the other touching the prominent centre
of the forehead, and falling thence on the most
prominent part of the upper jaw-bone, the head
being viewed in profile. In the angle produced
by these two lines, may be said to consist, not
only the distinctions between the skulls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
several species of animals, but also those which
are found to exist between different nations; and
it might be concluded that nature has availed herself
of this angle to mark out the diversities of
the animal kingdom, and at the same time to establish
a scale from the inferior tribes up to the
most beautiful forms which are found in the human
species. Thus it will be found that the heads of
birds display the smallest angle, and that it always
becomes of greater extent as the animal approaches
more nearly to the human figure. Thus, there is
one species of the ape tribe, in which the head has
a facial angle of forty-two degrees; in another animal
of the same family, which is one of those
simi&aelig; most approximating in figure to mankind,
the facial angle contains exactly fifty degrees.
Next to this is the head of an African negro,
which, as well as that of the Kalmuc, forms an
angle of seventy degrees; while the angle discovered
in the heads of Europeans contains eighty
degrees. On this difference of ten degrees in the
facial angle, the superior beauty of the European
depends; while that high character of sublime
beauty, which is so striking in some works of
ancient statuary, as in the head of Apollo, and in
the Medusa of Sisocles, is given by an angle
which amounts to one hundred degrees."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319">[Pg 319]</a></span>This method was seductive from its exceeding
simplicity. Unfortunately, facts were against it,
as happens to a good many theories. The curious
and interesting discoveries of Prof. Owen have
proved beyond dispute, that Camper, as well as
other anatomists since him, founded all their observations
on orangs of immature age, and that,
while the jaws become enlarged, and lengthened
with the increase of the maxillary apparatus, and
the zygomatic arch is extended, no corresponding
increase of the brain takes place. The importance
of this difference of age, with respect to the facial
angle, is very great in the simi&aelig;. Thus, while
Camper, measuring the skull of young apes, has
found the facial angle even as much as sixty-four
degrees; in reality, it never exceeds, in the most
favored specimen, from thirty to thirty-five.
Between this figure and the seventy degrees of the
negro and Kalmuc, there is too wide a gap to
admit of the possibility of Camper's ascending
series.</p>

<p>The advocates of phrenological science eagerly
espoused the theory of the Dutch <i>savant</i>. They
imagined that they could detect a development of
instincts corresponding to the rank which the animal
occupied in his scale. But even here facts
were against them. It was objected that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320">[Pg 320]</a></span> elephant&mdash;not
to mention numerous other instances&mdash;whose
intelligence is incontestably superior to that
of the orang, presents a much more acute facial
angle than the latter. Even among the ape tribes,
the most intelligent, those most susceptible of
education, are by no means the highest in Camper's
scale.</p>

<p>Besides these great defects, the theory possessed
another very weak point. It did not apply to all
the varieties of the human species. The races
with pyramidal skulls found no place in it. Yet
this is a sufficiently striking characteristic.</p>

<p>Camper's theory being refuted, <cite>Blumenbach</cite> proposed
another system. He called his invention
<i>norma verticalis</i>, the vertical method. According
to him,<a name="FNanchor-124" id="FNanchor-124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> the comparison of the breadth of the
head, particularly of the vertex, points out the
principal and most strongly marked differences in
the general configuration of the cranium. He
adds that the whole cranium is susceptible of so
many varieties in its form, the parts which contribute
more or less to determine the national
character displaying such different proportions and
directions, that it is impossible to subject all these
diversities to the measurement of any lines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
angles. In comparing and arranging skulls according
to the varieties in their shape, it is preferable
to survey them in that method which presents
at one view the greatest number of characteristic
peculiarities. "The best way of obtaining this
end is to place a series of skulls, with the cheek-bones
on the same horizontal line, resting on the
lower jaws, and then, viewing them from behind,
and fixing the eye on the vertex of each, to mark
all the varieties in the shape of parts that contribute
most to the national character, whether
they consist in the direction of the maxillary and
malar bones, in the breadth or narrowness of the
oval figure presented by the vertex, or in the flattened
or vaulted form of the frontal bone."</p>

<p>The results which Blumenbach deduced from
this method, were a division of mankind into
five grand categories, each of which was again
subdivided into a variety of families and types.</p>

<p>This classification, also, is liable to many objections.
Like Camper's, it left out several important
characteristics. <cite>Owen</cite> supposed that these
objections might be obviated by measuring the
basis of the skull instead of the summit. "The
relative proportions and extent," says Prichard,
"and the peculiarities of formation of the different
parts of the cranium, are more fully discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
by this mode of comparison, than by any other."
One of the most important results of this method
was the discovery of a line of demarcation between
man and the anthropoid apes, so distinct,
and clearly drawn, that it becomes thenceforward
impossible to find between the two genera the
connecting link which Camper supposed to exist.
It is, indeed, sufficient to cast one glance at the
bases of two skulls, one human, and the other
that of an orang, to perceive essential and decisive
differences. The antero-posterior diameter of
the basis of the skull is, in the orang, very much
longer than in man. The zygoma is situated in
the middle region of the skull, instead of being
included, as in all races of men, and even human
idiots, in the anterior half of the basis cranii; and
it occupies in the basis just one-third part of the
entire length of its diameter. Moreover, the position
of the great occipital foramen is very different
in the two skulls; and this feature is very important,
on account of its relations to the general
character of structure, and its influence on the
habits of the whole being. This foramen, in the
human head, is very near the middle of the basis
of the skull, or, rather, it is situated immediately
behind the middle transverse diameter; while, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the adult chimpantsi, it is placed in the middle of
the posterior third part of the basis cranii.<a name="FNanchor-125" id="FNanchor-125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a></p>

<p>Owen certainly deserves great credit for his observations,
but I should prefer the most recent, as
well as ingenious, of cranioscopic systems, that of
the learned American, Dr. Morton, which has been
adopted by Mr. Carus.<a name="FNanchor-126" id="FNanchor-126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a></p>

<p>The substance of this theory is, that individuals
are superior in intellect in proportion as their skulls
are larger.<a name="FNanchor-127" id="FNanchor-127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> Taking this as the general rule, Dr.
Morton and Mr. Carus proceed thereby to demonstrate
the difference of races. The question to be
decided is, whether all types of the human race
have the same craniological development.</p>

<p>To elucidate this fact, Dr. Morton took a certain
number of skulls, belonging to the four principal
human families&mdash;Whites, Mongolians, Negroes,
and North American Indians&mdash;and, after
carefully closing every aperture, except the <i>foramen
magnum</i>, he measured their capacity by filling
them with well dried grains of pepper. The results
of this measurement are exhibited in the
subjoined table.<a name="FNanchor-128" id="FNanchor-128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a></p>

<p>The results given in the first two columns are
certainly very curious, but to those in the last two
I attach little value. These two columns, giving
the maximum and minimum capacities, differ so
greatly from the second, which shows the average,
that they could be of weight only if Mr. Morton
had experimented upon a much greater number of
skulls, and if he had specified the social position
of the individuals to whom they belonged. Thus,
for his specimens of the white and copper-colored
races, he might select skulls that had belonged to
individuals rather above the common herd.<a name="FNanchor-129" id="FNanchor-129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> But<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the Blacks and Mongolians were not represented
by the skulls of their great chiefs and mandarins.
This explains why Dr. Morton could ascribe the
figure 100 to an aboriginal of America, while the
most intelligent Mongolian that he examined did
not exceed 93, and is surpassed even by the negro,
who reaches 94. Such results are entirely incomplete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326">[Pg 326]</a></span>fortuitous, and of no scientific value. In
questions of this kind, too much care cannot be
taken to reject conclusions which are based upon
the examination of individualities. I am, therefore,
unable to accept the second half of Dr. Morton's
calculations.</p>

<p>I am also disposed to doubt one of the details
in the other half. The figures 100, 83, and 78,
respectively indicating the average capacity of the
skull of the white, Mongolian, and negro, follow
a clear and evident gradation. But the figures 83,
81, and 82, given for the Mongol, the Malay, and
the red-skin, are conflicting; the more so, as Mr.
Carus does not hesitate to comprise the Mongols
and Malays into one and the same race, and thus
unites the figures 83 and 81&mdash;by which he receives,
as the average capacity of the yellow race,
82, or the same as that of the red-skins. Wherefore,
then, take the figure 82 as the characteristic
of a distinct race, and thus create, quite arbitrarily,
a fourth great subdivision of our species.</p>

<p>This anomaly supports the weak side of Mr.
Carus's system. The learned Saxon amuses himself
by supposing that, just as we see our planet
pass through the four stages of day, night, morning
twilight, and evening twilight, so there <em>must</em>
be four subdivisions of the human species, corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327">[Pg 327]</a></span>to these variations of light. He perceives
in this a symbol,<a name="FNanchor-130" id="FNanchor-130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> which is always a dangerous
temptation to a mind of refined susceptibilities.
The white races are to him the nations of day;
the black, those of night; the yellow, those of
morning; the red, those of evening. It will be
perceived how many ingenious analogies may be
brought forward in support of this fanciful invention.
Thus, the European nations, by the brilliancy
of their scientific discoveries and their superior
civilization, are in an enlightened state, while the
blacks are plunged in the gloomy darkness of
ignorance. The Eastern nations live in a sort of
twilight, which affords them an incomplete, though
powerful, social existence. And as for the Indians
of the Western World, who are rapidly disappearing,
what more beautiful image of their destiny
can be found than the setting sun?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, parables are no arguments, and
Mr. Carus has somewhat injured his beautiful
theory by unduly abandoning himself to this
poetical current. Moreover, what I have said
with regard to all other ethnological theories&mdash;those
of Camper, Blumenbach, and Owen&mdash;holds
good of this: Mr. Carus does not succeed in systematizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328">[Pg 328]</a></span>regularly the whole of the physiological
diversities observable in races.<a name="FNanchor-131" id="FNanchor-131"></a><a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a></p>

<p>The advocates for unity of species have not
failed to take advantage of this inability on the
part of their opponents to find a system which
will include the many varieties of the human
family; and they pretend that, as the observations
upon the conformation of the skull cannot be reduced
to a system which demonstrates the original
separation of types, the different varieties must be
regarded as simple divergencies occasioned by adventitious
and secondary causes, and which do not
prove a difference of origin.</p>

<p>This is crying victory too soon. The difficulty
of finding a method does not always prove that
none can be found. But the believers in the
unity of species did not admit this reserve. To
set off their theory, they point to the fact that certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329">[Pg 329]</a></span>tribes, belonging to the same race, instead of
presenting the same physical type, diverge from it
very considerably. They cite the different groups
of the mixed Malay-Polynesian family; and, without
paying attention to the proportion of the elements
which compose the mixtures, they say that
if groups of the same origin can assume such
totally different craniological and facial forms, the
greatest diversities of that kind do not prove the
primary plurality of origins.<a name="FNanchor-132" id="FNanchor-132"></a><a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a> Strange as it may
be to European eyes, the distinct types of the
negro and the Mongolian are not then demonstrative
of difference of species; and the differences
among the human family must be ascribed
simply to certain local causes operating during a
greater or less lapse of time.<a name="FNanchor-133" id="FNanchor-133"></a><a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330">[Pg 330]</a></span>The advocates for the plurality of races, being
met with so many objections, good as well as bad,
have attempted to enlarge the circle of their arguments,
and, ceasing to make the skull their only
study, have proceeded to the examination of the
entire individual. They have rightly shown that
the differences do not exist merely in the aspect
of the face and formation of the skull, but, what
is no less important, they exist also in the shape
of the pelvis, the relative proportion of the limbs,
and the nature of the pilous system.</p>

<p>Camper and other naturalists had long since
perceived that the pelvis of the negro presented
certain peculiarities. Dr. Vrolik extended his researches
further, and observed that in the European
race the differences between the male and
female pelvis are much less distinctly marked,
while the pelvis of the negro, of either sex, partakes
in a very striking degree of the animal character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331">[Pg 331]</a></span>The Amsterdam <i>savant</i>, starting from the
idea that the formation of the pelvis necessarily
influences that of the f&oelig;tus, concludes that there
must be difference of origin.<a name="FNanchor-134" id="FNanchor-134"></a><a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Weber has attacked this theory with but
little success. He was obliged to allow that certain
formations of the pelvis occur more frequently
in one race than in another; and all he could do,
was to show that the rule is not without exceptions,
and that some individuals of the American, African,
or Mongol race presented the forms common
among the European. This is not proving a great
deal, especially as it never seems to have occurred
to Mr. Weber that these exceptions might be
owing to a mixture of blood.</p>

<p>The adversaries of the unity doctrine pretend
that the European is better proportioned. They
are answered that the excessive leanness of the
extremities among those nations which subsist
principally on vegetable diet, or whose alimentation
is imperfect, is not at all surprising; and this
reply is certainly valid. But a much less conclusive
reply is made to the argument drawn from
the excessive development of bust among the
mountaineers of Peru (Quichuas) by those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
are unwilling to recognize it as a specific characteristic;
for to pretend, as they do, that it can be
explained by the elevation of the Andes, is not
advancing a very serious reason.<a name="FNanchor-135" id="FNanchor-135"></a><a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> There are in

constituted very differently from the Quichuas.<a name="FNanchor-136" id="FNanchor-136"></a><a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a></p>

<p>The color of the skin is another argument for
diversity of origin. But the opposite party refuse
to accept this as a specific characteristic, for two
reasons: first, because, they say, this coloration
depends upon climatic circumstances, and is not
permanent&mdash;which is, to say the least of it, a
very bold assertion; secondly, because color is
liable to indefinite gradations, by which white
insensibly passes into yellow, yellow into black,
so that it is impossible to find a line of demarcation
sufficiently decided. This fact simply proves
the existence of innumerable hybrids; an observation
to which the advocates for unity are constantly
inattentive.</p>

<p>With regard to the specific differences in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
formation of the pile, Mr. Flourens brings his great
authority in favor of the original unity of race.<a name="FNanchor-137" id="FNanchor-137"></a><a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334">[Pg 334]</a></span>I have now passed rapidly in review the more
or less inconsistent arguments of the advocates of
unity; but their strongest one still remains. It is
of great force, and I therefore reserved it for the
last&mdash;the facility with which the different branches
of the human family produce hybrids, and the
fecundity of these hybrids themselves.</p>

<p>The observations of naturalists seem to have
well established the fact that half-breeds can
spring only from nearly related species, and that
even in that case they are condemned to sterility.
It has been further observed that, even among
closely allied species, where fecundation is possible,
copulation is repugnant, and obtained, generally,
either by force or ruse, which would lead
us to suppose that, in a state of nature, the number
of hybrids is even more limited than that
obtained by the intervention of man. It has,
therefore, been concluded that, among the number
of specific characteristics, we must place the
faculty of producing prolific offspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335">[Pg 335]</a></span>As nothing authorizes us to believe that the
human race are exempt from this law, so nothing
has hitherto been able to shake the strength of
this objection,<a name="FNanchor-138" id="FNanchor-138"></a><a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> which, more than all the others,
holds the advocates for plurality in check. It is,
indeed, affirmed that, in certain portions of Oceanica,
indigenous women, after having brought forth
a half-breed European child, can no longer be
fecundated by compatriots. If this assertion be
admitted as correct, it might serve as a starting
point for further investigations; but at present it
could not be used to invalidate the admitted principles
of science upon the generation of hybrids&mdash;against
the deductions drawn from these it proves
nothing.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="center">PERMANENCY OF TYPES.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>The language of Holy Writ in favor of common origin&mdash;The
permanency of their characteristics separates the races of
men as effectually as if they were distinct creations&mdash;Arabs,
Jews&mdash;Prichard's argument about the influence of climate
examined&mdash;Ethnological history of the Turks and Hungarians.</p></div>


<p>The believers in unity of race affirm that types
are different in appearance only; that, in fact, the
differences existing among them are owing to local
circumstances still in operation, or to an accidental
peculiarity of conformation in the progenitor of a
branch, and that, though they all, more or less,
diverge from the original prototype, they all are
capable of again returning to it. According to
this, then, the negro, the North American savage,
the Tungoose of North Siberia, might, under
favorable circumstances, gain all the physical and
mental attributes which now distinguish the European.
Such a theory is inadmissible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337">[Pg 337]</a></span>We have shown above that the only solid scientific
stronghold of the believers in unity of species
is the prolificness of human hybrids. This fact,
which seems at present so difficult to refute, may
not always present the same difficulties, and would
not, by itself, suffice to arrest my conclusions,
were it not supported by another argument which,
I confess, appears to me of greater moment:
Scripture is said to declare against difference of
origin.</p>

<p>If the text is clear, peremptory, and indisputable,
we must submit; the most serious doubts must
disappear; human reason, in its imperfection, must
bow to faith. Better to let the veil of obscurity
cover a point of erudition, than to call in question
so high and incontestable an authority. If the
Bible declares that mankind are descended from
the same common stock, all that goes to prove the
contrary is mere semblance, unworthy of consideration.
But is the Bible really explicit on this
point? The sacred writings have a much higher
purpose than the elucidation of ethnological problems;
and if it be admitted that they may have
been misunderstood in this particular, and that
without straining the text, it may be interpreted
otherwise, I return to my first impression.</p>

<p>The Bible evidently speaks of Adam as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
progenitor of the white race, because from him
are descended generations which&mdash;it cannot be
doubted&mdash;were white. But nothing proves that
at the first redaction of the Adamite genealogies
the colored races were considered as forming part
of the species. There is not a word said about the
yellow nations, and I hope to prove, in my second
volume, that the pretended black color of the
patriarch Ham rests upon no other basis than an
arbitrary interpretation. At a later period, doubtless,
translators and commentators, who affirmed
that Adam was the father of all beings called men,
were obliged to bring in as descendants of the sons
of Noah all the different varieties with whom they
were acquainted. In this manner, Japheth was
considered the progenitor of the European nations,
while the inhabitants of the greater portion of
Asia were looked upon as the descendants of
Shem; and those of Africa, of Ham. This arrangement
answers admirably for one portion of
the globe. But what becomes of the population
of the rest of the world, who are not included in
this classification?</p>

<p>I will not, at present, particularly insist upon
this idea. I dislike the mere appearance of impugning
even simple interpretations if they have
the sanction of the church, and wish merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
intimate that their authority might, perhaps, be
questioned without transgressing the limits established
by the church.<a name="FNanchor-139" id="FNanchor-139"></a><a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a> If this is not the case, and
we must accept, in the main, the opinions of the
believers in unity, I still do not despair that the
facts may be explained in a manner different from
theirs, and that the principal physical and moral
differences among the branches of the human
family may exist, with all their necessary consequences,
independently of unity or plurality of
origin.</p>

<p>The specific identity of all canines is acknowledged,<a name="FNanchor-140" id="FNanchor-140"></a><a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a>
but who would undertake the difficult
task of proving that all these animals, to whatever
variety they may belong, were possessed of
the same shapes, instincts, habits, qualities? The
same is the case with many other species, the
equine, bovine, ursine, etc. Here we find perfect
identity of origin, and yet diversity in every other
respect, and a diversity so radical, that even intermixture
can not produce a real identity of character
in the several types. On the contrary, so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
as each type remains pure, their distinctive features
are permanent, and reproduced, without any sensible
deviation, in each successive generation.<a name="FNanchor-141" id="FNanchor-141"></a><a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a></p>

<p>This incontestable fact has led to the inquiry
whether in those species which, by domestication,
have lost their original habits, and contracted
others, the forms and instincts of the primitive
stock were still discernible. I think this highly
improbable, and can hardly believe that we shall
ever be able to determine the shape and characteristics
of the prototype of each species, and how
much or how little it is approached by the deviations
now before our eyes. A very great number
of vegetables present the same problem, and with
regard to man, whose origin it is most interesting
and important for us to know, the inquiry seems
to be attended with the greatest and most insurmountable
difficulties.</p>

<p>Each race is convinced that its progenitor had
precisely the characteristics which now distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
it. This is the only point upon which their traditions
perfectly agree. The white races represent
to themselves an Adam and Eve, whom Blumenbach
would at once have pronounced Caucasians;
the Mohammedan negroes, on the contrary, believe
the first pair to have been black; these being created
in God's own image, it follows that the Supreme
Being, and also the angels, are of the same
color, and the prophet himself was certainly too
greatly favored by his Sender to display a pale
skin to his disciples.<a name="FNanchor-142" id="FNanchor-142"></a><a href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, modern science has as yet found
no clue to this maze of opinions. No admissible
theory has been advanced which affords the least
light upon the subject, and, in all probability, the
various types differ as much from their common
progenitor&mdash;if they possess one&mdash;as they do among
themselves. The causes of these deviations are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
exceedingly difficult to ascertain. The believers
in the unity of origin pretend to find them, as I remarked
before, in various local circumstances, such
as climate, habits, &amp;c. It is impossible to coincide
with such an opinion, for, although these circumstances
have always existed, they have not, within
historical times, produced such alterations in the
races which were exposed to their influence as to
make it even probable that they were the causes
of so vast and radical a dissimilarity as we now
see before us. Suppose two tribes, not yet departed
from the primitive type, to inhabit, one an
alpine region in the interior of a continent, the
other some isolated isle in the immensity of the
ocean. Their atmospheric and alimentary conditions
would, of course, be totally different. If we
further suppose one of these tribes to be abundantly
provided with nourishment, and the other
possessing but precarious means of subsistence;
one to inhabit a cold latitude, and the other to be
exposed to the action of a tropical sun; it seems
to me that we have accumulated the most essential
local contrasts. Allowing these physical causes to
operate a sufficient lapse of time, the two groups
would, no doubt, ultimately assume certain peculiar
characteristics, by which they might be distinguished
from each other. But no imaginable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
length of time could bring about any essential,
organic change of conformation; and as a proof
of this assertion, I would point to the populations
of opposite portions of the globe, living under
physical conditions the most widely different, who,
nevertheless, present a perfect resemblance of type.</p>

<p>The Hottentots so strongly resemble the inhabitants
of the Celestial Empire, that it has even been
supposed, though without good reasons, that they
were originally a Chinese colony. A great similarity
exists between the ancient Etruscans, whose
portraits have come down to us, and the Araucanians
of South America. The features and outlines
of the Cherokees seem to be perfectly identical
with those of several Italian populations, the
Calabrians, for instance. The inhabitants of Auvergne,
especially the female portion, much more
nearly resemble in physiognomy several Indian
tribes of North America than any European nation.
Thus we see that in very different climes,
and under conditions of life so very dissimilar,
nature can reproduce the same forms. The peculiar
characteristics which now distinguish the different
types cannot, therefore, be the effects of
local circumstances such as now exist.<a name="FNanchor-143" id="FNanchor-143"></a><a href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344">[Pg 344]</a></span>Though it is impossible to ascertain what physical
changes different branches of the human
family may have undergone anterior to the historic
epoch, yet we have the best proofs that since
then, no race has changed its peculiar characteristics.
The historic epoch comprises about one
half of the time during which our earth is supposed
to have been inhabited, and there are several
nations whom we can trace up to the verge of
ante-historic ages; yet we find that the races then
known have remained the same to our days, even
though they ceased to inhabit the same localities,
and consequently were no longer exposed to the
influence of the same external conditions.</p>

<p>Witness the Arabs. As they are represented
on the monuments of Egypt, so we find them at
present, not only in the arid deserts of their native
land, but in the fertile regions and moist climate
of Malabar, Coromandel, and the islands of the
Indian Ocean. We find them again, though more
mixed, on the northern coasts of Africa, and, although
many centuries have elapsed since their
invasion, traces of Arab blood are still discernible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
in some portions of Roussillon, Languedoc, and
Spain.</p>

<p>Next to the Arabs I would instance the Jews.
They have emigrated to countries in every respect
the most dissimilar to Palestine, and have not
even preserved their ancient habits of life. Yet
their type has always remained peculiar and the
same in every latitude and under every physical
condition. The warlike Rechabites in the deserts
of Arabia present to us the same features as our
own peaceable Jews. I had occasion not long
since to examine a Polish Jew. The cut of his
face, and especially his eyes, perfectly betrayed
his origin. This inhabitant of a northern zone,
whose direct ancestors for several generations had
lived among the snows and ice of an inhospitable
clime, seemed to have been tanned but the day
before, by the ardent rays of a Syrian sun. The
same Shemitic face which the Egyptian artist represented
some four thousand or more years ago,
we recognize daily around us; and its principal
and really characteristic features are equally
strikingly preserved under the most diverse climatic
circumstances. But the resemblance is not
confined to the face only, it extends to the conformation
of the limbs and the nature of the temperament.
German Jews are generally smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and more slender in stature than the European
nations among whom they have lived for centuries;
and the age of puberty arrives earlier
with them than with their compatriots of another
race.<a name="FNanchor-144" id="FNanchor-144"></a><a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a></p>

<p>This is, I am aware, an assertion diametrically
opposed to Mr. Prichard's opinions. This celebrated
physiologist, in his zeal to prove the unity
of species, attempts to prove that the age of puberty
in both sexes is the same everywhere and
among all races. His arguments are based upon
the precepts of the Old Testament and the Koran,
by which the marriageable age of women is fixed
at fifteen, and even eighteen, according to Abou-Hanifah.<a name="FNanchor-145" id="FNanchor-145"></a><a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a></p>

<p>I hardly think that biblical testimony is admissible
in matters of this kind, because the Scriptures
often narrate facts which cannot be accounted
for by the ordinary laws of nature. Thus, the
pregnancy of Sarah at an extreme old age, and
when Abraham himself was a centenarian, is an
event upon which no ordinary course of reasoning
could be based. As for the precepts of the Mohammedan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347">[Pg 347]</a></span>law, I would observe that they were
intended to insure not merely the physical aptitude
for marriage, but also that degree of mental maturity
and education which befit a woman about
to enter on the duties of so serious a station. The
prophet makes it a special injunction that the religious
education of young women should be continued
to the time of their marriage. Taking this
view, the law-giver would naturally incline to delay
the period of marriage as long as possible, in order
to afford time for the development of the reasoning
faculties, and he would therefore be less precipitate
in his authorizations than nature in hers. But
there are some other proofs which I would adduce
against Mr. Prichard's grave arguments, which,
though of less weighty character, are not the less
conclusive, and will settle the question, I think, in
my favor.</p>

<p>Poets, in their tales of love, are mainly solicitous
of exhibiting their heroines in the first bloom of
beauty, without caring much about their moral and
mental development. Accordingly, we find that
oriental poets have always made their lovers much
younger than the age prescribed by the Koran.
Zelika and Leila are not, surely, fourteen years
old. In India, this difference is still more striking.
Sacontala, in Europe, would be quite a small girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
a mere child. The spring-time of life for a Hindoo
female is from the age of nine to that of twelve.
In the Chinese romance, <cite>Yu-Kiao-li</cite>, the heroine is
sixteen; and her father is in great distress, and
laments pathetically that at so advanced an age
she should still be unmarried. The Roman writers,
following in the footsteps of their Greek preceptors,
took fifteen as the period of bloom of a
woman's life; our own authors for a long time adhered
to these models, but since the ideas of the
North have begun to exert their influence upon
our literature, the heroines of our novels are full-grown
young ladies of eighteen, and very often
more.<a name="FNanchor-146" id="FNanchor-146"></a><a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a></p>

<p>But arguments of a more serious character are
by no means wanting. Besides what I said of the
precocity of the Jews in Germany, I may point
out the reverse as a peculiarity of the population
of many portions of Switzerland. Among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
the physical development is so slow, that the age
of puberty is not always attained at twenty. The
Zingaris, or gypsies, display the same physical
precocity as their Hindoo ancestry, and, under the
austere sky of Russia and Moldavia, they preserve,
together with their ancient notions and habits, the
general aspect of face and form of the Pariahs.<a name="FNanchor-147" id="FNanchor-147"></a><a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a></p>

<p>I do not, however, wish to attack Mr. Prichard
upon all points. There is one of his conclusions
which I readily adopt, viz.: "<em>that the difference of
climate occasions very little, if any, important diversity
as to the periods of life and the physical changes
to which the human constitution is subject</em>."<a name="FNanchor-148" id="FNanchor-148"></a><a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a> This
conclusion is very well founded, and I shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
seek to invalidate it; but it appears to me that it
contradicts a little the principles so ably advocated
by the learned physiologist and antiquary.</p>

<p>The reader must have perceived that the discussion
turns solely upon permanency of type. If
it can be proved that the different branches of the
human family are each possessed of a certain individuality
which is independent of climate and the
lapse of ages, and can be effaced only by intermixture,
the question of origin is reduced to
little importance; for, in that case, the different
types are no less completely and irrevocably separated
than if their specific differences arose from
diversity of origin.</p>

<p>That such is the case, we have already proved
by the testimony of Egyptian sculptures with regard
to the Arabs, and by our observations upon
the Jews and gypsies. Should any further proofs
be needed, we would mention that the paintings
in the temples and subterraneous buildings of the
Nile valley as indubitably attest the permanence
of the negro type. There we see the same crisped
hair, prognathous skull, and thick lips. The recent
discovery of the bas-reliefs of Khorsabad<a name="FNanchor-149" id="FNanchor-149"></a><a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a> has removed
beyond doubt the conclusions previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
formed from the figured monuments of Persepolis,
viz.: that the present Assyrian nations are
physiologically identical with those who formerly
inhabited the same regions.</p>

<p>If similar investigations could be made upon a
greater number of existing races, the results would
be the same. We have established the fact of permanence
of types in all cases where investigation
is possible, and the burden of proof, therefore, falls
upon the dissenting party.</p>

<p>Their arguments, indeed, are in direct contradiction
to the most obvious facts. Thus they allege,
although the most ordinary observation shows the
contrary, that climate <em>has</em> produced alterations in
the Jewish type, inasmuch as many light-haired,
blue-eyed Jews are found in Germany. For this
argument to be of any weight in their position,
the advocates for unity of race must recognize climate
to be the sole, or at least principal, cause of
this phenomenon. But the adherents of that doctrine
elsewhere assert that the color of the eyes,
hair, and skin, no ways depends upon geographical
situation or the action of heat and cold.<a name="FNanchor-150" id="FNanchor-150"></a><a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> As an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
evidence of this, they justly cite the Cinghalese,
who have blue eyes and light hair;<a name="FNanchor-151" id="FNanchor-151"></a><a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a> they even
observe among them a very considerable difference
of complexion, varying from a light brown to
black. Again, they admit that the Samoiedes and
Tungusians, though living on the borders of the
Frozen Ocean,<a name="FNanchor-152" id="FNanchor-152"></a><a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> have an exceedingly swarthy complexion.
If, therefore, climate exerts no influence
upon the complexion and color of hair and eyes,
these marks must be considered as of no importance,
or as pertaining to race. We know that red
hair is not at all uncommon in the East, and at no
time has been so; it cannot, therefore, create much
surprise if we occasionally find it among the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
of Germany. This fact cannot be adduced as evidence
either in favor of, or against, the permanence
of types.</p>

<p>The advocates for unity are no less unfortunate
in their historical arguments. They furnish but
two; the Turks and the Magyars. The Asiatic
origin of the former is supposed to be established
beyond doubt, as well as of their intimate relationship
with the Finnic branches of the Laplanders
and Ostiacs. It follows from this that they must
originally have displayed the yellow skin, projecting
cheek bones, and low stature of the Mongolian
races. This point being settled, we are told to look
at the Turks of our day, who exhibit all the characteristics
of the European type. Types, then,
are not permanent, it is victoriously concluded,
because the Turks have undergone such a transformation.
"It is true," say the adherents of the
unity school, "that some pretend there had been
an admixture of Greek, Georgian, and Circassian
blood. But this admixture can have taken place
only to a very limited extent; all Turks are not
rich enough to buy their wives in the Caucasus, or
to have seraglios filled with white slaves; on the
other hand, the hatred which the Greeks cherish
for their conquerors, and the religious antipathies
of both nations, were not favorable to alliances<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
between them, and consequently we see them&mdash;though
inhabiting the same country&mdash;as distinct
at this day as at the time of the conquest."<a name="FNanchor-153" id="FNanchor-153"></a><a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a></p>

<p>These arguments are more specious than solid.
In the first place, I am greatly disposed to doubt
the Finnic origin of the Turkish race, because the
only evidence that has hitherto been produced in
favor of this supposition is affinity of language,
and I shall hereafter give my reasons for believing
this argument&mdash;when unsupported by any other&mdash;as
extremely unreliable, and open to doubt. But
even if we suppose the ancestors of the Turkish
nation to belong to the yellow race, it is easy to
show why their descendants have so widely departed
from that type.</p>

<p>Centuries elapsed from the time of the first appearance
of the Turanian hordes to the day which
saw them the masters of the city of Constantine,
and during that period, multifarious events took
place; the fortune of the Western Turks has been
a checkered one. Alternately conquerors or conquered,
masters or slaves, they have become incorporated
with various nationalities. According to
the annalists,<a name="FNanchor-154" id="FNanchor-154"></a><a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> their Orghuse ancestors, who descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355">[Pg 355]</a></span>from the Altai Mountains, inhabited in
Abraham's time the immense steppes of Upper
Asia which extend from Katai to the sea of Aral,
from Siberia to Thibet, and which, as has recently
been proved&mdash;were then the abode of numerous
Germanic tribes.<a name="FNanchor-155" id="FNanchor-155"></a><a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> It is a singular circumstance,
that the first mentioning by Oriental writers of the
tribes of Turkestan is in celebrating them for
their beauty of face and form.<a name="FNanchor-156" id="FNanchor-156"></a><a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> The most extravagant
hyperboles are lavished on them without
reserve, and as these writers had before their eyes
the handsomest types of the old world with which
to compare them, it is not probable that they
should have wasted their enthusiasm on creatures
so ugly and repulsive as are generally the races of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
pure Mongolian blood. Thus, notwithstanding
the dicta of philology, I think serious doubts
might be raised on that point.<a name="FNanchor-157" id="FNanchor-157"></a><a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a></p>

<p>But I am willing to admit that the Turcomannic
tribes were, indeed, as is supposed, of Finnic origin.
Let us come down to a later period&mdash;the Mohammedan
era. We then find these tribes under various
denominations and in equally various situations,
dispersed over Persia and Asia Minor. The
Osmanli were not yet existing at that time, and
their predecessors, the Seldjuks, were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
greatly mixed with the races that had embraced
Islamism. We see from the example of Gha&iuml;ased-din-Keikosrew,
who lived in 1237, that the Seljuk
princes were in the habit of frequently intermarrying
with Arab women. They must have gone
still further, for we find that Aseddin, the mother
of one of the Seljuk dynasties, was a Christian.
It is reasonable to suppose, that if the chiefs of
the nation, who everywhere are the most anxious
to preserve the purity of their genealogy, showed
themselves so devoid of prejudice, their subjects
were still less scrupulous on that point. Their
constant inroads in which they ranged over vast
districts, gave them ample opportunities for capturing
slaves, and there is every reason to believe
that already in the 13th century, the ancient
Orghuse branch was strongly tinctured with Shemitic
blood.</p>

<p>To this branch belonged Osman, the son of Ortoghrul,
and father of the Osmanli. But few
families were collected around his tent. His army
was, at first, little better than a band of adventurers,
and the same expedient which swelled the
ranks of the first builders of Rome, increased the
number of adherents of this new Romulus of the
Steppes. Every desperate adventurer or fugitive,
of whatever nation, was welcome among them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
and assured of protection. I shall suppose that
the downfall of the Seljuk empire brought to their
standards a great number of their own race. But
we have already said that this race was very much
mixed; and besides, this addition was insufficient,
as is proved by the fact that, from that time, the
Turks began to capture slaves for the avowed purpose
of repairing, by this means, the waste which
constant warfare made in their own ranks. In
the beginning of the 14th century, the sultan Orkhan,
following the advice of his vizier, Khalil
Tjendereli, surnamed the Black, instituted the
famous military body called Janissaries.<a name="FNanchor-158" id="FNanchor-158"></a><a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> They
<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page359" id="page359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
were composed entirely of Christian children captured
in Poland, Germany, Italy, or the Bizantine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360">[Pg 360]</a></span>Empire, who were educated in the Mohammedan
religion and the practice of arms. Under
Mohammed IV., their number had increased to
140,000 men. Here, then, we find an influx of at
least half a million male individuals of European
blood in the course of four centuries.</p>

<p>But the infusion of European blood was not
limited to this. The piracy which was carried on,
on so large a scale, in the whole basin of the Mediterranean,
had for one of its principal objects
the replenishment of the harems. Every victory
gained increased the number of believers in the
Prophet. A great number of the prisoners of war
abjured Christianity, and were henceforth counted
among the true believers. The localities adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
to the field of battle supplied as many females as
the marauding victors could lay hold of. In some
cases, this sort of booty was so plentiful that it
became inconvenient to dispose of. Hammer relates<a name="FNanchor-159" id="FNanchor-159"></a><a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a>
that, on one occasion, the handsomest female
captive was bartered for <em>one boot</em>. When we consider
that the Turkish population of the whole
Ottoman empire never exceeded twelve millions,
it becomes apparent that the history of so amalgamated
a nation affords no arguments, either for or
against, the permanency of type. We will now
proceed to the second historic argument advanced
by the believers in unity.</p>

<p>"The Magyars," they say, "are of Finnic origin,
nearly related to the Laplanders, Samoiedes, and
Esquimaux, all of which are people of low stature,
with big faces, projecting cheek-bones, and
yellowish or dirty brown complexion. Yet the
Magyars are tall, well formed, and have handsome
features. The Finns have always been feeble, unintelligent,
and oppressed; the Magyars, on the
contrary, occupy a distinguished rank among the
conquerors of the earth, and are noted for their
love of liberty and independence. As they are
so immensely superior, both physically and morally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362">[Pg 362]</a></span>to all the collateral branches of the Finnic
stock, it follows that they have undergone an
enormous transformation."<a name="FNanchor-160" id="FNanchor-160"></a><a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a></p>

<p>If such a transformation had ever taken place,
it would, indeed, be astonishing and inexplicable
even to those who ascribe the least stability to
types, for it must have occurred within the last
800 years, during which we know that the compatriots
of St. Stephen<a name="FNanchor-161" id="FNanchor-161"></a><a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a> mixed but little with surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363">[Pg 363]</a></span>nations. But the whole course of reasoning
is based upon false premises, for the Hungarians
are most assuredly not of Finnic origin.
Mr. A. De G&eacute;rando<a name="FNanchor-162" id="FNanchor-162"></a><a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a> has placed this fact beyond
doubt. He has proved, by the authority of Greek
and Arab historians, as well as Hungarian annalists
and by indisputable philological arguments,
that the Magyars are a fragment of that great inundation
of nations which swept over Europe
under the denomination of Huns. It will be objected
that this is merely giving the Hungarians
another parentage, but which connects them no
less intimately with the yellow race. Such is not
the case. The designation of Huns applies not
only to a nation, but is also a collective appellation
of a very heterogeneous mass. Among the
tribes which rallied around the standards of Attila
and his ancestors, there were some which have at all
times been distinguished from the rest by the term
<em>white Huns</em>. Among them the Germanic blood
predominated.<a name="FNanchor-163" id="FNanchor-163"></a><a href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a> It is true, that the close contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
with the yellow race somewhat adulterated the
breed; but this very fact is singularly exhibited
in the somewhat angular and bony facial conformation
of the Hungarians. I conclude, therefore,
that the Magyars were <em>white Huns</em>, and of Germanic
origin, though slightly mixed with the Mongolian
stock.</p>

<p>The philological difficulty of their speaking a
non-Germanic dialect is not insurmountable. I
have already alluded to the Mongolian Scyths
who yet spoke an Arian tongue;<a name="FNanchor-164" id="FNanchor-164"></a><a href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a> I might, moreover,
cite the Norman settlers in France who, not
many years after their conquest, exchanged their
Scandinavian dialect, in a great measure, for the
Celto-Latin of their subjects,<a name="FNanchor-165" id="FNanchor-165"></a><a href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> whence sprang that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
singular compound called Norman-French, which
the followers of William the Conqueror imported
into England, and which now forms an element of
the English language.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no reason to suppose that
the agency of climate and change of habits have
transformed a Laplander, or an Ostiak, or a
Tunguse, or a Permian, into a St. Stephen or a
Kossuth.</p>

<p>Having thus, I think, refuted the only two historical
instances which the believers in unity of
species adduce, of a pretended alteration of type
by local circumstances and change of habits, and
having, moreover, instanced several cases where
these causes could produce no alteration; the fact
of permanency of type seems to me to be incontestably
established.<a name="FNanchor-166" id="FNanchor-166"></a><a href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> Thus, whichever side we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
take, whether we believe in original unity, or
original diversity, is immaterial; the several groups
of the human species are, at present, so perfectly
separated from each other, that no exterior influence
can efface their distinctive peculiarities. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
permanency of these differences, so long as there
is no intermixture, produces precisely the same
physical and moral results as if the groups were
so many distinct and separate creations.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I shall repeat what I have said
above, that I have very serious doubts as to the
unity of origin. These doubts, however, I am compelled
to repress, because they are in contradiction
to a scientific fact which I cannot refute&mdash;the prolificness
of half-breeds; and secondly, what is of
much greater weight with me, they impugn a
religious interpretation sanctioned by the church.</p>

<blockquote><p>[In supervising the publication of this work, I have
thought proper to omit, in this place, a portion of the
translation, because containing ideas and suggestions
which&mdash;though they might be novel to a French public&mdash;have
often been laid before English readers, and as
often proven untenable. This omission, however, embraces
no essential feature of the book, no link of the
chain of argumentation. It extends no further than
a digressional attempt of the author to account for the
diversities observable in the various branches of the
human family, by imagining the existence of cosmogonal
causes, long since effete, but operating for a time
soon after the creation of man, when the globe was
still in a nascent and chaotic state. It must be obvious
that all such speculations can never bridge over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
wide abyss which separates <em>hypotheses</em> from <em>facts</em>.
They afford a boundless field for play to a fertile
imagination, but will never stand the test of criticism.
Even if we were to suppose that such causes had effected
diversities in the human family in primeval times, the
types thus produced must all have perished in the
flood, save that to which Noah and his family belonged.
If these writers, however, should be disposed to deny
the universality of the deluge, they would evidently
do greater violence to the language of Holy Writ, than
by at once supposing a plurality of origins for mankind.</p>

<p>The legitimate field of human science is the investigation
of the laws <em>now</em> governing the material world.
Beyond this it may not go. Whatever is recognized as
not coming within the scope of action of these laws,
belongs not to its province. We have proved, and I
think it is generally admitted, that the actual varieties
of the human family are <em>permanent</em>; that there are no
causes <em>now in operation</em>, which can transform them.
The investigation of those causes, therefore, cannot
properly be said to belong to the province of human
science. In regard to their various systems of classification,
naturalists may be permitted to dispute about
unity or plurality of species, because the use of the
word species is more or less arbitrary; it is an expedient
to secure a convenient arrangement. But none,
I hope, presume ever to be able to fathom the mysteries
of Creative Power&mdash;to challenge the fiat of the Almighty,
and inquire into his <em>means</em>.&mdash;H.]</p></blockquote>

<p>In the investigation of the moral and intellectual
diversities of races, there is no difficulty so
great as an accurate classification. I am disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
to think a separation into three great groups sufficient
for all practical purposes. These groups I
shall call primary varieties, not in the sense of
distinct creations, but as offering obvious and well-defined
distinguishing characteristics. I would
designate them respectively by the terms white,
yellow, and black. I am aware of the inaccuracy
of these appellations, because the complexion is
not always the distinctive feature of these groups:
other and more important physiological traits must
be taken into consideration. But as I have not
the right to invent new names, and am, therefore,
compelled to select among those already in
use, I have chosen these because, though by no
means correct, they seemed preferable to others
borrowed from geography or history, and not so
apt as the latter to add to the confusion which
already sufficiently perplexes the investigator of
this subject. To obviate any misconception here
and hereafter, I wish it to be distinctly understood
that by "white" races I mean those usually comprised
under the name of Caucasian, Shemitic,
Japhetic; by "black," the Hamitic, African, etc.;
by "yellow," the Altaic, Mongolian, Finnic, and
Tartar. These I consider to be the three categories
under which all races of the human family
can be placed. I shall hereafter explain my reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
for not recognizing the American Indians as a
separate variety, and for classing them among the
yellow races.<a name="FNanchor-167" id="FNanchor-167"></a><a href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372">[Pg 372]</a></span>It is obvious that each of these groups comprises
races very dissimilar among themselves,
each of which, besides the general characteristics<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page373" id="page373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
belonging to the whole group, possesses others
peculiar to itself. Thus, in the group of black
races we find marked distinctions: the tribes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
prognathous skull and woolly hair, the low-caste
Hindoos of Kamaoun and of Dekhan, the Pelagian
negroes of Polynesia, etc. In the yellow
group, the Tungusians, Mongols, Chinese, etc.
There is every reason to believe that these sub-varieties
are coeval; that is, the same causes which
produced one, produced at the same time all the
others.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, extremely difficult to determine
the typical character of each variety. In the
white, and also in the yellow group, the mixture
of the sub-varieties is so great, that it is impossible
to fix upon the type. In the black group,
the type is perhaps discernible; at least, it is preserved
in its greatest purity.</p>

<p>To ascertain the relative purity or mixture of a
race, a criterion has been adopted by many, who
consider it infallible: this is resemblance of face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
form, constitution, etc. It is supposed that the
purer a race has preserved itself, the greater must
be the exterior resemblances of all the individuals
composing it. On the contrary, considerable and
varied intermixtures would produce an infinite
diversity of appearance among individuals. This
fact is incontestable, and of great value in ethnological
science, but I do not think it quite so reliable
as some suppose.</p>

<p>Intermixture of races does, indeed, produce at
first individual dissemblances, for few individuals
belong in precisely the same degree to either of
the races composing the mixture. But suppose
that, in course of time, the fusion has become complete&mdash;that
every individual member of the mixed
race had precisely the same proportion of mixed
blood as every other&mdash;he could not then differ
greatly from his neighbor. The whole mass, in
that case, must present the same general homogeneity
as a pure race. The perfect amalgamation
of two races of the same group would, therefore,
produce a new type, presenting a fictitious appearance
of purity, and reproducing itself in succeeding
generations.</p>

<p>I imagine it possible, therefore, that a "secondary"
type may in time assume all the characteristics
of a "primary" one, viz: resemblance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
individuals composing it. The lapse of time to
produce this complete fusion would necessarily be
commensurate to the original diversity of the constituent
elements. Where two races belonging to
different groups combine, such a complete fusion
would probably never be possible. I can illustrate
this by reference to individuals. Parents of widely
different nations generally have children but little
resembling each other&mdash;some apparently partaking
more of the father's type, some more of the mother's.
But if the parents are both of the same,
or at least of homogeneous stocks, their offspring
exhibits little or no variety; and though the children
might resemble neither of the parents, they
would be apt to resemble one another.</p>

<p>To distinguish the varieties produced by a fusion
of proximate races from those which are the effect
of intermixture between races belonging to different
groups, I shall call the latter <em>tertiary</em> varieties.
Thus the woolly-headed negro and the Pelagian
are both "primary" varieties belonging to the same
group; their offspring I would call a "secondary"
variety; but the hymen of either of them with a
race belonging to the white or yellow groups,
would produce a "tertiary" variety. To this last,
then, belong the mulatto, or cross between white
and black, and the Polynesian, who is a cross between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377">[Pg 377]</a></span>the black and the yellow.<a name="FNanchor-168" id="FNanchor-168"></a><a href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a> Half-breeds of
this kind display, in various proportions and degrees,
the special characteristics of both the ancestral
races. But a complete fusion, as in the case
of branches of the same group, probably never
results from the union of two widely dissimilar
races, or, at least, would require an incommensurable
lapse of time.</p>

<p>If a tertiary type is again modified by intermixture
with another, as is the case in a cross between
a mulatto and a Mongolian, or between a Polynesian
and a European, the ethnical mixture is too
great to permit us, in the present state of the
science, to arrive at any general conclusions. It
appears that every additional intermixture increases
the difficulty of complete fusion. In a population
composed of a great number of dissimilar ethnical
elements, it would require countless ages for a
thorough amalgamation; that is to say, so complete
a mixture that each individual would have
precisely the kind and relative proportion of mixed
blood as every other. It follows, therefore, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
in a population so constituted, there is an infinite
diversity of form and features among individuals,
some pertaining more to one type than another.
In other words, there being no equilibrium between
the various types, they crop out here and
there without any apparent reason.</p>

<p>We find this spectacle among the great civilized
nations of Europe, especially in their capitals and
seaports. In these great vortexes of humanity, every
possible variety of our species has been absorbed.
Negro, Chinese, Tartar, Hottentot, Indian, Malay,
and all the minor varieties produced by their mixture,
have contributed their contingent to the population
of our large cities. Since the Roman domination,
this amalgamation has continually increased,
and is still increasing in proportion as our inventions
bring in closer proximity the various portions
of the globe. It affects all classes to some extent,
but more especially the lowest. Among them you
may see every type of the human family more or
less represented. In London, Paris, Cadiz, Constantinople,
in any of the greater marts and thoroughfares
of the world, the lower strata of the
<em>native</em> population exhibit every possible variety,
from the prognathous skull to the pyramidal: you
shall find one man with hair as crisp as a negro's;
another, with the eyes of an ancient German, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
the oblique ones of a Chinese; a third, with a
thoroughly Shemitic countenance; yet all three
may be close relations, and would be greatly surprised
were they told that any but the purest white
blood flows in their veins. In these vast gathering
places of humanity, if you could take the first
comer&mdash;a native of the place&mdash;and ascend his
genealogical tree to any height, you would probably
be amazed at the strange ancestry at the top.</p>

<p>It may now be asked whether, for all the various
races of which I have spoken, there is but one
standard of beauty, or whether each has one of its
own. Helvetius, in his <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">De l'Esprit</cite>, maintains that
the idea of beauty is purely conventional and variable.
This assertion found many advocates in
its time, but it is at present superseded by the
more philosophical theory that the conception of
the beautiful is an absolute and invariable idea,
and can never have a merely optional application.
Believing the latter view to be correct, I do not
hesitate to compare the various races of man in
point of beauty, and to establish a regular scale of
gradation. Thus, if we compare the various races,
from the ungainly appearance of the Pelagian or
Pecherai up to the noble proportions of a Charlemagne,
the expressive regularity of features of a
Napoleon, or the majestic countenance of a Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
XIV., we shall find in the lowest on the scale a
sort of rudimentary development of the beauty
which attracts us in the highest; and in proportion
to the perfectness of that development, the races
rise in the scale of beauty.<a name="FNanchor-169" id="FNanchor-169"></a><a href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> Taking the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
race as the standard of beauty, we perceive all
the others more or less receding from that model.
There is, then, an inequality in point of beauty
among the various races of men, and this inequality
is permanent and indelible.<a name="FNanchor-170" id="FNanchor-170"></a><a href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a></p>

<p>The next question to be decided is, whether
there is also an inequality in point of physical
strength. It cannot be denied that the American
Indians and the Hindoos are greatly inferior to us
in this respect. Of the Australians, the same may
safely be asserted. Even the negroes possess less
muscular vigor.<a name="FNanchor-171" id="FNanchor-171"></a><a href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a> It is necessary, however, to distinguish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382">[Pg 382]</a></span>between purely muscular force&mdash;that which
exerts itself suddenly at a given moment&mdash;and the
force of resistance or capacity for endurance. The
degree of the former is measured by its intensity,
that of the other by its duration. Of the two, the
latter is the typical&mdash;the standard by which to
judge of the capabilities of races. Great muscular
strength is found among races notoriously weak.
Among the lowest of the negro tribes, for instance,
it would not be difficult to find individuals that
could match an experienced European wrestler or
English boxer. This is equally true of the Lascars
and Malays. But we must take the masses, and
judge according to the amount of long-continued,
persevering toil and fatigue they are capable of.
In this respect, the white races are undoubtedly
entitled to pre-eminence.</p>

<p>But there are differences, again, among the white
races, both in beauty and in strength, which even
the extensive ethnical mixture, that European nations
present, has not entirely obliterated. The
Italians are handsomer than the French and the
Spaniards, and still more so than the Swiss and
Germans. The English also present a high degree
of corporeal beauty; the Sclavonian nations a
comparatively humble one.</p>

<p>In muscular power, the English rank far above<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
all other European nations; but the French and
Spaniards are greatly superior in power of endurance:
they suffer less from fatigue, from privations,
and the rigors and changes of climate. This
question has been settled beyond dispute by the
fatal campaign in Russia. While the Germans,
and other troops from the North, who yet were
accustomed to severe cold, were almost totally
annihilated, the French regiments, though paying
fearfully dear for their retreat, nevertheless saved
the greatest number of men. Some have attempted
to explain this by a supposed superiority on the
part of the French in martial education and military
spirit. But the German officers had certainly
as high a conception of a soldier's duty, as elevated
a sentiment of honor, as our soldiers; yet
they perished in incredibly greater numbers. I
think it can hardly be disputed that the masses of
the population of France possess a superiority in
certain physical qualities, which enables them to
defy with greater impunity than most other nations
the freezing snows of Russia and the burning
sands of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the words of Van Amringe, "from the brutal New
Hollander, who secures his wife by knocking her down
with a club and dragging the prize to his cave, to the
polished European, who, fearfully, but respectfully and
assiduously, spends a probation of months or years for
his better half, the ascent may be traced with unfailing
precision and accuracy." The same writer correctly
argues that if any principle could be inferred from analogy
to animals, it would certainly be a uniform treatment
of the female sex among all races of man; for animals
are remarkably uniform in the relations of the male and
female in the same species. Yet among some races of
men <em>polygamy has always prevailed, among others never</em>.
Would not any naturalist consider as distinct species
any animals of the same genus so distinguished? This
subject has not yet met with due attention at the hands of
ethnologists. "When we hear of a race of men," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the same author, "being subjected to the tyranny of
another race, either by personal bondage or the more
easy condition of tribute, our sympathies are enlisted
in their favor, and our constant good wishes, if not our
efforts, accompany them. But when we hear of hundreds
of millions of the truest and most tender-hearted
of human creatures being trodden down and trampled
upon in everything that is dear to the human heart, our
sympathies, which are so freely expended on slighter
occasions or imaginary evils, are scarcely awakened to
their crushing woes."</p>

<p>With the writer from whom I have already made copious
extracts, I believe that the <em>moral and intellectual
diversity</em> of the races of men cannot be thoroughly and
accurately investigated without taking into consideration
the relations which most influence individual as
well as national progress and development, and which
result from the position occupied by woman towards
man. This truth has not escaped former investigators&mdash;it
would be singular if it had&mdash;but they have contented
themselves with asserting that the condition of
the female sex was indicative of the degree of civilization.
Had they said, of the intrinsic worth of various
races, I should cheerfully assent. But the elevation or
degradation of woman in the social scale is generally
regarded as a <em>result</em>, not a <em>cause</em>. It is said that all
barbarians treat their women as slaves; but, as they
progress in civilization, woman gradually rises to her
legitimate rank.</p>

<p>For the sake of the argument, I shall assume that
all now civilized nations at first treated their women
as the actual barbarians treat theirs. That this is
not so, I hope to place beyond doubt; but, assuming it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
to be the case, might not the fact that some left off that
treatment, while others did not, be adduced as a proof
of the inequality of races? "The law of the relation of
the sexes," says Van Amringe, "is more deeply engraven
upon human nature than any other; because, whatever
theories may be adopted in regard to the origin of society,
languages, etc., no doubt can be entertained that
the <em>influence of woman must have been anterior to any
improvements of the original condition of man</em>. Consequently
it was antecedent and superior to education
and government. That these relations were powerfully
instrumental in the origin of development, to give it a
direction and character according to the natures operating
and operated upon, cannot be doubted by any
one who has paid the slightest attention to domestic
influences, from and under which education, customs,
and government commenced."</p>

<p>But I totally deny that all races, in their first state
of development, treated their women equally. There
is not only no historical testimony to prove that <em>any</em> of
the white races were ever in such a state of barbarity
and in such moral debasement as most of the dark races
are to this day, and have always been, but there is positive
evidence to show that our barbarous ancestors assigned
to woman the same position we assign her now:
she was the companion, and not the slave, of man. I
have already alluded to this in a previous note on the
Teutonic races; I cannot, however, but revert to it
again.</p>

<p>As I have not space for a lengthy discussion, I shall
mention but one fact, which I think conclusive, and
which rests upon incontrovertible historical testimony.
"To a German mind," says Tacitus (Murphy's transl.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
vol. vii. 8), "the idea of a woman led into captivity is
insupportable. In consequence of this prevailing sentiment,
the states which deliver as hostages the daughters
of illustrious families are bound by the most effectual
obligations." Did this assertion rest on the authority
of Tacitus only, it might perhaps be called in question.
It might be said that the illustrious Roman had drawn
an ideal picture, etc. But C&aelig;sar dealt with realities,
not idealities; he was a shrewd, practical statesman,
and an able general; yet C&aelig;sar <em>did</em> take females as
hostages from the German tribes, in preference to men.
Suppose C&aelig;sar had made war against the King of
Ashantee, and taken away some of his three thousand
three hundred and thirty-three wives, the mystical number
being thus forcibly disturbed, might have alarmed
the nation, whose welfare is supposed to depend on it;
but the misfortune would soon have been remedied.</p>

<p>But it is possible to demonstrate not only that all
races did not treat their women equally in their first
stage of development, but also that no race which assigned
to woman in the beginning an inferior position
ever raised her from it in any subsequent stage of development.
I select the Chinese for illustration, because
they furnish us with an example of a long-continued
and regular intellectual progress,<a name="FNanchor-172" id="FNanchor-172"></a><a href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> which yet never resulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388">[Pg 388]</a></span>in an alteration of woman's position in the social
structure. The decadent Chinese of our day look upon
the female half of their nation as did the rapidly advancing
Chinese of the seventh and eighth centuries;
and the latter in precisely the same manner as their
barbarous ancestors, the subjects of the Emperor <em>Fou</em>,
more than twenty centuries before.</p>

<p>I repeat it, the relations of the sexes, in various
races, are equally dissimilar in every stage of development.
The state of society may change, the tendency
of a race never. Faculties may be developed, but
never lost.</p>

<p>As the mothers and wives of our Teutonic ancestors
were near the battle-field, to administer refreshments
to the wearied combatants, to stanch the bleeding of
their wounds, and to inspire with renewed courage the
despairing, so, in modern times, matrons and maidens
of the highest rank&mdash;worthy daughters of a heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389">[Pg 389]</a></span> ancestry&mdash;have
been found by thousands ready to sacrifice
the comforts and quiet of home for the horrors of a
hospital.<a name="FNanchor-173" id="FNanchor-173"></a><a href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a> As the rude warrior of a former age won his
beloved by deeds of valor, so, to his civilized descendant,
the hand of his mistress is the prize and reward of
exertion. The wives and mothers of the ancient Germans
and Celts were the counsellors of their sons and
husbands in the most important affairs; our wives and
mothers are our advisers in our more peaceful pursuits.</p>

<p>But the Arab, when he had arrived at the culminating
point of his civilization, and when he had become the
teacher of our forefathers of the Middle Ages in science
and the arts, looked upon his many wives in the same
light as his roaming brother in the desert had done
before, and does now. I do not ask of all these races
that they should assign to their women the same rank
that we do. If intellectual progress and social development
among them showed the slightest tendency to
produce ultimately an alteration in woman's position
towards her lord, I might be content to submit to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
opinion of those who regard that position as the effect
of such a progress and such a development. But I
cannot, in the history of those races, perceive the slightest
indication of such a result, and all my observations
lead me to the conclusion that the relations between the
sexes are a cause, and not an effect.</p>

<p>The character of the women of different races differs
in essential points. What a vast difference, for instance,
between the females of the rude crusaders who took
possession of Constantinople, and the more civilized
Byzantine Greeks whom they so easily conquered; between
the heroic matron of barbarous Germany and the
highly civilized Chinese lady! These differences cannot
be entirely the effect of education, else we are forced
to consider the female sex as mere automatons. They
must be the result of diversity of character. And why
not, in the investigation of the moral and intellectual
diversity of races and the natural history of man, take
into consideration the peculiarities that characterize the
female portion of each race, a portion&mdash;I am forced to
make this trite observation, because so many investigators
seem to forget it&mdash;which comprises at least one-half
of the individuals to be described?&mdash;H.</p>

"living" civilization&mdash;Limits of the sphere of intellectual
acquisitions.</p></div>


<p>To understand perfectly the differences existing
among races, in regard to their intellectual capacity,
it is necessary to ascertain the lowest degree of
stupidity that humanity is capable of. The inferior
branches of the human family have hitherto
been represented, by a majority of scientific observers,
as considerably more abased than they are
in reality. The first accounts of a tribe of savages
almost always depict them in exaggerated colors
of the darkest cast, and impute to them such utter
intellectual and reasoning incapacity, that they
seem to sink to the level of the monkey, and below<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
that of the elephant. There are, indeed, some contrasts.
Let a navigator be well received in some
island&mdash;let him succeed in persuading a few of the
natives to work, however little, with the sailors,
and praises are lavished upon the fortunate tribe:
they are declared susceptible of every improvement;
and perhaps the eulogist will go so far as
to assert that he has found among them minds of
a very superior order.</p>

<p>To both these judgments we must object&mdash;the
one being too favorable, the other too severe. Because
some natives of Tahiti assisted in repairing
a whaler, or some inhabitant of Tonga Tabou exhibited
good feelings towards the white strangers
who landed on his isle, it does not follow that
either are capable of receiving our civilization, or
of being raised to a level with us. Nor are we
warranted in classing among brutes the poor naturals
of a newly-discovered coast, who greet their
first visitors with a shower of stones and arrows,
or who are found making a dainty repast on raw
lizards and clods of clay. Such a meal does not,
indeed, indicate a very superior intelligence, or
very refined manners. But even in the most repulsive
cannibal there lies latent a spark of the
divine flame, and reason may be awakened to a
certain extent. There are no tribes so very degraded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393">[Pg 393]</a></span>that they do not reason in some degree,
whether correctly or otherwise, upon the things
which surround them. This ray of human intelligence,
however faint it may be, is what distinguishes
the most degraded savage from the most
intelligent brute, and capacitates him for receiving
the teachings of religion.</p>

<p>But are these mental faculties, which every individual
of our species possesses, susceptible of
indefinite development? Have all men the same
capacity for intellectual progress? In other words,
can cultivation raise all the different races to the
same intellectual standard? and are no limits imposed
to the perfectibility of our species? My
answer to these questions is, that all races are
capable of improvement, but all cannot attain the
same degree of perfection, and even the most
favored cannot exceed a certain limit.</p>

<p>The idea of infinite perfection has gained many
partisans in our times, because we, like all who
came before us, pride ourselves upon possessing
advantages and points of superiority unknown to
our predecessors. I have already spoken of the
distinguishing features of our civilization, but willingly
revert to this subject again.</p>

<p>It may be said, that in all the departments of
science we possess clearer and more correct notions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394">[Pg 394]</a></span>that, upon the whole, our manners are more
polished, and our code of morals is preferable to
that of the ancients. It is further asserted, as the
principal proof of our superiority, that we have
better defined, juster and more tolerant ideas with
regard to political liberty. Sanguine theorists are
not wanting, who pretend that our discoveries in
political science and our enlightened views of the
rights of man will ultimately lead us to that universal
happiness and harmony which the ancients
in vain sought in the fabled garden of Hesperides.</p>

<p>These lofty pretensions will hardly bear the test
of severe historical criticism.</p>

<p>If we surpass preceding generations in scientific
knowledge, it is because we have added
our share to the discoveries which they bequeathed
to us. We are their heirs, their pupils, their continuators,
just as future generations will be ours.
We achieve great results by the application of the
power of steam; we have solved many great problems
in mechanics, and pressed the elements as
submissive slaves into our service. But do these
successes bring us any nearer to omniscience. At
most, they may enable us ultimately to fathom all
the secrets of the material world. And when we
shall have achieved that grand conquest, for which
so much requires still to be done that is not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
commenced, nor even anticipated; have we advanced
a single step beyond the simple exposition
of the laws which govern the material world?
We may have learned to direct our course through
the air, to approach the limits of the respirable
atmosphere; we may discover and elucidate several
interesting astronomical problems; we may
have greater powers for controlling nature and
compelling her to minister to our wants, but can
all this knowledge make us better, happier beings?
Suppose we had counted all the planetary systems
and measured the immense regions of space, would
we know more of the grand mystery of existence
than those that came before us? Would this add
one new faculty to the human mind, or ennoble
human nature by the eradication of one bad passion?</p>

<p>Admitting that we are more enlightened upon
some subjects, in how many other respects are we
inferior to our more remote ancestors? Can it be
doubted, for instance, that in Abraham's times much
more was known of primordial traditions than the
dubious beams which have come down to us?
How many discoveries which we owe to mere accident,
or which are the fruits of painful efforts,
were the lost possessions of remote ages? How
many more are not yet restored? What is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
in the most splendid of our works that can compare
with those wonders by which Egypt, India,
Greece, and America still attest the grandeur and
magnificence of so many edifices which the weight
of centuries, much more than the impotent ravages
of man, has caused to disappear? What are
our works of art by the side of those of Athens;
our thinkers by the side of those of Alexandria
or India; our poets by the side of a Valmiki,
Kalidasa, Homer, Pindar?</p>

<p>The truth is, we pursue a different direction
from that of the human societies whose civilization
preceded ours. We apply our mind to different
purposes and different investigations; but
while we clear and cultivate new lands, we are
compelled to neglect and abandon to sterility those
to which they devoted their attention. What we
gain in one direction we lose in another. We
cannot call ourselves superior to the ancients, unless
we had preserved at least the principal acquisitions
of preceding ages in all their integrity, and
had succeeded in establishing by the side of these,
the great results which they as well as we sought
after. Our sciences and arts superadded to theirs
have not enabled us to advance one step nearer
the solution of the great problems of existence,
the mysteries of life and death. "I seek, but find<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
not," has always been, will ever be, the humiliating
confession of science when endeavoring to
penetrate into the secrets concealed by the veil
that it is not given to mortal to lift. In criticism<a name="FNanchor-174" id="FNanchor-174"></a><a href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a>
we are, undoubtedly, much in advance of our predecessors;
but criticism implies classification, not
acquisition.</p>

<p>Nor can we justly pride ourselves upon any
superiority in regard to political ideas. Political
and social theories were as rife in Athens after the
age of Pericles as they are in our days. To be
convinced of this, it is necessary only to study
Aristophanes, whose comedies Plato recommends
to the perusal of whoever wishes to become acquainted
with the public morals of the city of
Minerva. It has been pretended that our present
structure of society, and that of the ancients, admit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398">[Pg 398]</a></span>of no comparison, owing to the institution of
slavery which formed an element of the latter.
But the only real difference is that demagogism
had then an even more fertile soil in which to
strike root. The slaves of those days find their
precise counterpart in our working classes and
proletarians.<a name="FNanchor-175" id="FNanchor-175"></a><a href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a> The Athenian people propitiating
their servile class after the battle of Arginuses,
might be taken for a picture of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Look at Rome. Open Cicero's letters. What a
specimen of the moderate Tory that great Roman
orator was; what a similarity between his republic
and our constitutional bodies politic, with regard
to the language of parties and parliamentary debates!
There, too, the background of the picture
was occupied by degraded masses of a servile and
pr&aelig;dial population, always eager for change, and
ready to rise in actual rebellion.</p>

<p>Let us leave those dregs of the population,
whose civil existence the law ignored, and who
counted in politics but as the formidable tool of
designing individuals of free birth. But does not
the free population of Rome afford a perfect analogue
to a modern body politic? There is the mob<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
crying for bread, greedy of shows, flattery, gratuitous
distributions, and amusements; the middle
classes (<em>bourgeoisie</em>) monopolizing and dividing
among themselves the public offices; the hereditary
aristocracy, continually assailed at all points,
continually losing ground, until driven in mere
self-defence to abjure all superior claims and stipulate
for equal rights to all. Are not these perfect
resemblances?</p>

<p>Among the boundless variety of opinions that
make themselves heard in our day, there is not
one that had not advocates in Rome. I alluded a
while ago to the letters written from the villa of
Tusculum; they express the sentiments of the
Roman conservative <em>Progressist</em> party. By the side
of Sylla, Pompey and Cicero were Radicals.<a name="FNanchor-176" id="FNanchor-176"></a><a href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a> Their
notions were not sufficiently radical for C&aelig;sar;
too much so for Cato. At a later period we find
in Pliny the younger a mild royalist, a friend of
quiet, even at some cost. Apprehensive of too
much liberty, yet jealous of power too absolute;
very practical in his views, caring but little for
the poetical splendor of the age of the Fabii, he preferred
the more prosaic administration of Trajan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
There were others not of his opinion, good people
who feared an insurrection headed by some new
Spartacus, and who, therefore, thought that the
Emperor could not hold the reins too tight.
Then there were others, from the provinces,
who obstreperously demanded and obtained what
would now be called "constitutional guaranties."
Again, there were the socialists, and their views
found no less an expounder than the Gallic C&aelig;sar,
C. Junius Posthumus, who exclaims: "Dives et
pauper, inimici," the rich and the poor are enemies
born.</p>

<p>Every man who had any pretensions to participate
in the lights of the day, declaimed on the
absolute equality of all men, their "inalienable
rights," the manifest necessity and ultimate universality
of the Greco-Latin civilization, its superiority,
its mildness, its future progress, much greater
even than that actually made, and above all its
perpetuity. Nor were those ideas merely the
pride and consolation of the pagans; they were
the firm hopes and expectations of the earliest
and most illustrious Fathers of the Church, whose
sentiments found so eloquent an interpreter in
Tertullian.</p>

<p class="tbreak">And as a last touch, to complete the picture, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
us not forget those people who, then as now, formed
the most numerous of all parties: those that
belonged to none&mdash;people who are too weak-minded,
or indifferent, or apprehensive, or disgusted,
to lay hold of a truth, from among the
midst of contradictory theories that float around
them&mdash;people who are content with order when
it exists, submit passively in times of disorder
and confusion; who admire the increase of conveniences
and comforts of life unknown to their
ancestors, and who, without thinking further,
centre their hope in the future and pride in the
present, in the reflection: "What wonderful facilities
we enjoy now-a-days."</p>

<p>There would be some reason for believing in an
improvement in political science, if we had invented
some governmental machinery which had
hitherto been unknown, or at least never carried
into practice. This glory we cannot arrogate to
ourselves. Limited monarchies were known in
every age. There are even some very curious
examples of this form of government found among
certain Indian tribes who, nevertheless, have remained
savages. Democratic and aristocratic republics of
every form, and balanced in the most varied manner,
flourished in the new world as well as the old.
Tlascala is as complete a model of this kind as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Athens, Sparta, or Mecca before Mohammed's times.
And even supposing that we have applied to governmental
science some secondary principle of
our own invention, does this justify us in our exaggerated
pretension to unlimited perfectibility?
Let us rather be modest, and say with the wisest
of kings: "<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil novi sub sole.</em>"<a name="FNanchor-177" id="FNanchor-177"></a><a href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a></p>

<p>It is said that our manners are milder than
those of the other great human societies; this assertion
also is very open to criticism. There are
some philanthropists who would induce nations no
longer to resort to armies in settling their quarrels.
The idea is borrowed from Seneca. Some of the
Eastern sages professed the same principles in this
respect as the Moravian Brethren. But assuming
that the members of the Peace Congress succeed
in disgusting Europe with the turmoil and miseries
of warfare, they would still have the difficult
task left of forever transforming the human passions.
Neither Seneca nor the Eastern sages have
been able to accomplish this, and it may reasonably
be doubted whether this grand achievement<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
is reserved for our generation. We possess pure
and exalted principles, I admit, but are they carried
into practice? Look at our fields, the streets
of our cities&mdash;the bloody traces of contests as
fierce as any recorded in history are scarcely yet
effaced. Never since the beginning of our civilization
has there been an interval of peace of fifty
years, and we are, in this respect, far behind
ancient Italy, which, under the Romans, once enjoyed
two centuries of perfect tranquillity. But
even so long a repose would not warrant us in
concluding that the temple of Janus was thenceforth
to be forever closed.</p>

<p>The state of our civilization does not, therefore,
prove the unlimited perfectibility of man. If he
have learned many things, he has forgotten others.
He has not added another to his senses; his soul
is not enriched by one new faculty. I cannot too
much insist upon the great though sad truth, that
whatever we gain in one direction is counterbalanced
by some loss in another; that, limited as
is our intellectual domain, we are doomed never to
possess its whole extent at once. Were it not for
this fatal law, we might imagine that at some period,
however distant, man, finding himself in
possession of the experience of successive ages,
and having acquired all that it is in his power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
acquire, would have learned at last to apply his
acquisitions to his welfare&mdash;to live without battling
against his kind, and against misery; to enjoy a
state, if not of unalloyed happiness, at least of
abundance and peace.</p>

<p>But even so limited a felicity is not promised
us here below, for in proportion as man learns he
unlearns; whatever he acquires, is at the cost of
some previous acquisition; whatever he possesses
he is always in danger of losing.</p>

<p>We flatter ourselves with the belief that our
civilization is imperishable, because we possess the
art of printing, gunpowder, the steam engine, &amp;c.
These are valuable means to accomplish great
results, but the accomplishment depends on their
use.</p>

<p>The art of printing is known to many other
nations beside ourselves, and is as extensively used
by them as by us.<a name="FNanchor-178" id="FNanchor-178"></a><a href="#Footnote-178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a> Let us see its fruits. In Tonquin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405">[Pg 405]</a></span>Anam, Japan, books are plentiful, much
cheaper than with us&mdash;so cheap that they are
within the reach of even the poorest&mdash;and even
the poorest read them. How is it, then, that these
people are so enervated, so degraded, so sunk in
sloth and vice<a name="FNanchor-179" id="FNanchor-179"></a><a href="#Footnote-179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a>&mdash;so near that stage in which even
civilized man, having frittered away his physical
and mental powers, may sink infinitely below the
rude barbarian, who, at the first convenient opportunity,
becomes his master? Whence this result?
Precisely because the art of printing is a means,
and not an agent. So long as it is used to diffuse
sound, sterling ideas, to afford wholesome and refreshing
nutriment to vigorous minds, a civilization
never decays. But when it becomes the vile
caterer to a depraved taste, when it serves only to
multiply the morbid productions of enervated or
vitiated minds, the senseless quibbles of a sectarian
theology instead of religion, the venomous scurrility
of libellists instead of politics, the foul obscenities
of licentious rhymers instead of poesy&mdash;how
and why should the art of printing save a
civilization from ruin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406">[Pg 406]</a></span>It is objected that the art of printing contributes
to the preservation of a civilization by the facility
with which it multiplies and diffuses the masterpieces
of the human mind, so that, even in times
of intellectual sterility, when they can no longer
be emulated, they still form the standard of taste,
and by their clear and steady light prevent the
possibility of utter darkness. But it should be
remembered that to delve in the hoarded treasures
of thought, and to appropriate them for purposes
of mental improvement, presupposes the possession
of that greatest of earthly goods&mdash;an enlightened
mind. And in epochs of intellectual degeneracy,
few care about those monuments of lost virtues
and powers; they are left undisturbed on their
dusty shelves in libraries whose silence is but seldom
broken by the tread of the anxious, painstaking
student.</p>

<p>The longevity which Guttenberg's invention
assures to the productions of genius is much
exaggerated. There are a few works that enjoy
the honor of being reproduced occasionally; with
this exception, books die now precisely as formerly
did the manuscripts. Works of science,
especially, disappear with singular rapidity from
the realms of literature. A few hundred copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
are struck off at first, and they are seldom, and,
after a while, never heard of more. With considerable
trouble you can find them in some large
collection. Look what has become of the thousands
of excellent works that have appeared since
the first printed page came from the press. The
greater portion are forgotten. Many that are still
spoken of, are never read; the titles even of others,
that were carefully sought after fifty years ago, are
gradually disappearing from every memory.</p>

<p>So long as a civilization is vigorous and flourishing,
this disappearance of old books is but a slight
misfortune. They are superseded; their valuable
portions are embodied in new ones; the seed
exists no longer, but the fruit is developing. In
times of intellectual degeneracy it is otherwise.
The weakened powers cannot grapple with the
solid thought of more vigorous eras; it is split up
into more convenient fragments&mdash;rendered more
portable, as it were; the strong beverage that once
was the pabulum of minds as strong, must be
diluted to suit the present taste; and innumerable
dilutions, each weaker than the other, immediately
claim public favor; the task of learning must be
lightened in proportion to the decreasing capacity
for acquiring; everything becomes superficial;
what costs the least effort gains the greatest esteem;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
play upon words is accounted wit; shallowness,
learning; the surface is preferred to the depth.
Thus it has ever been in periods of decay; thus it
will be with us when we have once reached that
point whence every movement is retrogressive.
Who knows but we are near it already?&mdash;and the
art of printing will not save us from it.</p>

<p>To enhance the advantages which we derive
from that art, the number and diffusion of manuscripts
have been too much underrated. It is true
that they were scarce in the epoch immediately
preceding; but in the latter periods of the Roman
empire they were much more numerous and much
more widely diffused than is generally imagined.
In those times, the facilities for instruction were
by no means of difficult access; books, indeed,
were quite common. We may judge so from the
extraordinary number of threadbare grammarians
with which even the smallest villages swarmed; a
sort of people very much like the petty novelists,
lawyers, and editors of modern times, and whose
loose morals, shabbiness, and passionate love for
enjoyments, are described in Pretronius's Satyricon.
Even when the decadence was complete, those who
wished for books could easily procure them. Virgil
was read everywhere; so much so, that the
illiterate peasantry, hearing so much of him, imagined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409">[Pg 409]</a></span>him to be some dangerous and powerful sorcerer.
The monks copied him; they copied Pliny,
Dioscorides, Plato, and Aristotle; they copied
Catullus and Martial. These books, then, cannot
have been very rare. Again, when we consider
how great a number has come down to us notwithstanding
centuries of war and devastation&mdash;notwithstanding
so many conflagrations of monasteries,
castles, libraries, &amp;c.&mdash;we cannot but admit
that, in spite of the laborious process of transcription,
literary productions must have been multiplied
to a very great extent. It is possible, therefore,
to greatly exaggerate the obligations under
which science, poetry, morality, and true civilization
lie to the typographic art; and I repeat it,
that art is a marvellous instrument, but if the arm
that wields it, and the head that directs the arm,
are not, the instrument cannot be, of much service.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the possession of gunpowder
exempts modern societies from many of
the dangers that proved fatal to the ancient. They
assert that it abates the horrors of warfare, and
diminishes its frequency, bidding fair, therefore, to
establish, in time, a state of universal peace. If
such be the beneficial results attendant on this accidental
invention, they have not as yet manifested
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410">[Pg 410]</a></span>Of the various applications of steam, and other
industrial inventions, I would say, as of the art of
printing, that they are great means, but their results
depend upon the agent. Such arts might be
practised by rote long after the intellectual activity
that produced them had ceased. There are innumerable
instances of processes which continue in
use, though the theoretical secret is lost. It is
therefore not unreasonable to suppose, that the
practice of our inventions might survive our civilization;
that is, it might continue when these inventions
were no longer possible, when no further
improvements were to be hoped for. Material
well-being is but an external appendage of a civilization;
intellectual activity, and a consequent
progress, are its life. A state of intellectual torpor,
therefore, cannot be a state of civilization,
even though the people thus stagnating, have the
means of transporting themselves rapidly from
place to place, or of adorning themselves and their
dwellings. This would only prove that they were
the <em>heirs</em> of a former civilization, but not that they
actually possessed one. I have said, in another
place, that a civilization may thus preserve, for a
time, every appearance of life: the effect may
continue after the cause has ceased. But, as a
continuous change seems to be the order of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
in all things material and immaterial, a downward
tendency is soon manifest. I have before compared
a civilization to the human body. While alive, it
undergoes a perpetual modification: every hour
has wrought a change; when dead, it preserves,
for a time, the appearance of life, perhaps even its
beauty; but gradually, symptoms of decay become
manifest, and every stage of dissolution is more
precipitate than the one before, as a stone thrown
up in the air, poises itself there for an inappreciable
fraction of time, then falls with continually
increasing velocity, more and more swiftly as it
approaches the ground.</p>

<p>Every civilization has produced in those who
enjoyed its fruits, a firm conviction of its stability,
its perpetuity.</p>

<p>When the palanquins of the Incas travelled
rapidly on the smooth, magnificent causeways
which still unite Cuzco and Quito, a distance of
fifteen hundred miles, with what feelings of exultation
must they have contemplated the conquests
of the present, what magnificent prospects of the
future must have presented themselves to their
imaginations! Stern time, with one blow of his
gigantic wings, hurled their empire into the deepest
depths of the abyss of oblivion. These proud
sovereigns of Peru&mdash;they, too, had their sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
their mechanical inventions, their powerful machines:
the works they accomplished we contemplate
with amazement, and a vain effort to divine
the means employed. How were those blocks of
stone, thirty-five feet long and eighteen thick,
raised one upon another? How were they transported
the vast distance from the quarries where
they were hewn? By what contrivance did the
engineers of that people hoist those enormous
masses to a dizzy height? It is indeed a problem&mdash;a
problem, too, which we will never solve. Nor
are the ruins of Tihuanaco unparalleled by the
remains of European civilizations of ante-historic
times. The cyclopean walls with which Southern
Europe abounds, and which have withstood the
all-destroying tooth of time for thousands upon
thousands of years&mdash;who built them? Who piled
these monstrous masses, which modern art could
scarcely move?</p>

<p>Let us not mistake the results of a civilization
for its causes. The causes cease, the results subsist
for a while, then are lost. If they again bear
fruit, it is because a new spirit has appropriated
them, and converted them to purposes often very
different from those they had at first. Human intelligence
is finite, nor can it ever reign at once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
the whole of its domain:<a name="FNanchor-180" id="FNanchor-180"></a><a href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a> it can turn to account
one portion of it only by leaving the other bare;
it exalts what it possesses, esteems lightly what it
has lost. Thus, every generation is at the same
time superior and inferior to its predecessors. Man
cannot, then, surpass himself: man's perfectibility
is not infinite.</p>

<p class="center">MUTUAL RELATIONS OF DIFFERENT MODES OF

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Necessary consequences of a supposed equality of all races&mdash;Uniform
testimony of history to the contrary&mdash;Traces of extinct
civilizations among barbarous tribes&mdash;Laws which govern
the adoption of a state of civilization by conquered populations&mdash;Antagonism

<p>Had it been the will of the Creator to endow
all the branches of the human family with equal
intellectual capacities, what a glorious tableau
would history not unfold before us. All being
equally intelligent, equally aware of their true
interests, equally capable of triumphing over
obstacles, a number of simultaneous and flourishing
civilizations would have gladdened every portion
of the inhabited globe. While the most
ancient Sanscrit nations covered Northern India
with harvests, cities, palaces, and temples; and the
plains of the Tigris and Euphrates shook under<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
the trampling of Nimrod's cavalry and chariots,
the prognathous tribes of Africa would have formed
and developed a social system, sagaciously
constructed, and productive of brilliant results.</p>

<p>Some luckless tribes, whose lot fortune had cast
in inhospitable climes, burning sands, or glacial
regions, mountain gorges, or cheerless steppes
swept by the piercing winds of the north, would
have been compelled to a longer and severer
struggle against such unpropitious circumstances,
than more fortunate nations. But being not inferior
in intelligence and sagacity, they would not
have been long in discovering the means of bettering
their condition. Like the Icelanders, the
Danes, and Norwegians, they would have forced
the reluctant soil to afford them sustenance; if
inhabitants of mountainous regions, they would,
like the Swiss, have enjoyed the advantages of a
pastoral life, or like the Cashmerians, resorted to
manufacturing industry. But if their geographical
situation had been so unfavorable as to admit of
no resource, they would have reflected that the
world was large, contained many a pleasant valley
and fertile plain, where they might seek the fruits
of intelligent activity, which their stepmotherly
native land refused them.</p>

<p>Thus all the nations of the earth would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
been equally enlightened, equally prosperous;
some by the commerce of maritime cities, others
by productive agriculture in inland regions, or
successful industry in barren and Alpine districts.
Though they might not exempt themselves from
the misfortunes to which the imperfections of
human nature give rise&mdash;transitory dissensions,
civil wars, seditions, etc.&mdash;their individual interests
would soon have led them to invent some system
of relative equiponderance. As the differences in
their civilizations resulted merely from fortuitous
circumstances, and not from innate inequalities, a
mutual interchange would soon have assimilated
them in all essential points. Nothing could then
prevent a universal confederation, that dream of
so many centuries; and the inhabitants of the
most distant parts of the globe would have been
as members of one great cosmopolite people.</p>

<p>Let us contrast this fantastic picture with the
reality. The first nations worthy of the name,
owed their formation to an instinct of aggregation,
which the barbarous tribes near them not only did
not feel then, but never afterward. These nations
spread beyond their original boundaries, and
forced others to submit to their power. But the
conquered neither adopted nor understood the
principles of the civilization imposed upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
Nor has the force of example been of avail to
those in whom innate capacity was wanting. The
native populations of the Spanish peninsula, and
of Transalpine and Ligurian Gaul, saw Phenicians,
Greeks, and Carthaginians, successively establish
flourishing cities on their coasts, without feeling
the least incitement to imitate the manners or
forms of government of these prosperous merchants.</p>

<p>What a glorious spectacle do not the Indians of
North America witness at this moment. They
have before their eyes a great and prosperous
nation, eminent for the successful practical application
of modern theories and sciences to political
and social forms, as well as to industrial art. The
superiority of this foreign race, which has so firmly
established itself upon his former patrimony, is
evident to the red man. He sees their magnificent
cities, their thousands of vessels upon the once
silent rivers, their successful agriculture; he knows
that even his own rude wants, the blanket with
which he covers himself, the weapon with which
he slays his game, the ardent spirits he has learned
to love so well, can be supplied only by the
stranger. The last feeble hope to see his native
soil delivered from the presence of the conqueror's
race, has long since vanished from his breast; he
feels that the land of his fathers is not his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Yet he stubbornly refuses to enter the pale of this
civilization which invites him, solicits him, tries to
entice him with superior advantages and comforts.
He prefers to retreat from solitude to solitude,
deeper and deeper into the primitive forest. He
is doomed to perish, and he knows it; but a mysterious
power retains him under the yoke of his
invincible repugnances, and while he admires the
strength and superiority of the whites, his conscience,
his whole nature, revolts at the idea of
assimilating to them. He cannot forget or smother
the instincts of his race.</p>

<p>The aborigines of Spanish America are supposed
to evince a less unconquerable aversion.
It is because the Spanish metropolitan government
had never attempted to civilize them. Provided
they were Christians, at least in name, they were
left to their own usages and habits, and, in many
instances, under the administration of their Caziques.
The Spaniards colonized but little, and
when the conquest was completed and their sanguinary
appetites glutted by those unparalleled
atrocities which brand them with indelible disgrace,
they indulged in a lazy toleration, and directed
their tyranny rather against individuals
than against modes of thinking and living. The
Indians have, in a great measure, mixed with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
conquerors, and will continue to live while their
brethren in the vicinity of the Anglo-Saxon race
are inevitably doomed to perish.</p>

<p>But not only savages, even nations of a higher
rank in the intellectual scale are incapable of
adopting a foreign civilization. We have already
alluded to the failure of the English in India and
of the Dutch in Java, in trying to import their
own ideas into their foreign dependencies. French
philanthropy is at this moment gaining the same
experience in the new French possession of Algeria.
There can be no stronger or more conclusive
proof of the various endowments of different
races.</p>

<p>If we had no other argument in proof of the
innate imparity of races than the actual condition
of certain barbarous tribes, and the supposition
that they had always been in that condition, and,
consequently, always would be, we should expose
ourselves to serious objections. For many barbarous
nations preserve traces of former cultivation
and refinement. There are some tribes, very degraded
in every other respect, who yet possess
traditional regulations respecting the marriage
celebration, the forms of justice and the division
of inheritances, which evidently are remnants of
a higher state of society, though the rites have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
long since lost all meaning. Many of the Indian
tribes who wander over the tracts once occupied
by the Alleghanian race, may be cited as instances
of this kind. The natives of the Marian Islands,
and many other savages, practise mechanically
certain processes of manufacture, the invention
of which presupposes a degree of ingenuity and
knowledge utterly at variance with their present
stupidity and ignorance. To avoid hasty and
erroneous conclusions concerning this seeming
decadence, there are several circumstances to be
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a savage population to fall within
the sphere of activity of a proximate, but superior
race. In that case they may gradually
learn to conform externally to the civilization of
their masters, and acquire the technicalities of
their arts and inventions. Should the dominant
race disappear either by expulsion or absorption,
the civilization would expire, but some of its outward
forms might be retained and perpetuated.
A certain degree of mechanical skill might survive
the scientific principles upon which it was
based. In other words, practice might long continue
after the theory was lost. History furnishes
us a number of examples in support of this assertion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421">[Pg 421]</a></span>Such, for instance, was the attitude of the Assyrians
toward the civilization of the Chaldeans; of
the Iberians, Celts, and Illyrians towards that of
the Romans. If, then, the Cherokees, the Catawbas,
Muskogees, Seminoles, Natchez and other
tribes, still preserve a feeble impress of the Alleghanian
civilization, I should not thence conclude
that they are the pure and direct descendants of
the initiatory element of that people, which would
imply that a race may once have been civilized,
and be no longer so. I should say, on the contrary,
that the Cherokees, if at all ethnically connected
with the ancient dominant type, are so by
only a collateral tie of consanguinity, else they
could never have relapsed into a state of barbarism.
The other tribes which exhibit little or no
vestiges of the former civilization are probably
the descendants of a different conquered population
which formed no constituent element of the
society, but served rather as the substratum upon
which the edifice was erected. It is no matter of
surprise, if this be the case, that they should preserve&mdash;without
understanding them and with a
sort of superstitious veneration&mdash;customs, laws,
and rites invented by others far more intelligent
than themselves.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the mechanical arts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
The aborigines of the Carolines are about the
most interesting of the South Sea islanders. Their
looms, sculptured canoes, their taste for navigation
and commerce show them vastly superior to
the Pelagian negroes, their neighbors. It is easy
to account for this superiority by the well-authenticated
admixture of Malay blood. But as this
element is greatly attenuated, the inventions which
it introduced have not borne indigenous fruits,
but, on the contrary, are gradually, but surely,
disappearing.</p>

<p>The preceding observations will, I think, suffice
to show that the traces of civilization among a
barbarous tribe are not a necessary proof that this
tribe itself has ever been really civilized. It may
either have lived under the domination of a superior
but consanguineous race, or living in its vicinity,
have, in an humble and feeble degree, profited
by its lessons. This result, however, is possible
only when there exists between the superior
and the inferior race a certain ethnical affinity;
that is to say, when the former is either a noble
branch of the same stock, or ennobled by intermixture
with another. When the disparity between
races is too great and too decided, and there
is no intermediate link to connect them, the contact
is always fatal to the inferior race, as is abundantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423">[Pg 423]</a></span>proved by the disappearance of the aborigines
of North America and Polynesia.</p>

<p>I shall now speak of the relations arising from
the contact of different civilizations.</p>

<p>The Persian civilization came in contact with
the Grecian; the Egyptian with the Grecian and
Roman; the Roman with the Grecian; and finally
the modern civilization of Europe with all those
at present subsisting on the globe, and especially
with the Arabian.</p>

<p>The contact of Greek intelligence with the culture
of the Persians was as frequent as it was
compulsory. The greater portion of the Hellenic
population, and the wealthiest, though not the
most independent, was concentrated in the cities
of the Syrian coast, the Greek colonies of Asia
Minor, and on the shores of the Euxine, all of
which formed a part of the Persian dominions.
Though these colonies preserved their own local
laws and politics, they were under the authority
of the satraps of the great king. Intimate relations,
moreover, were maintained between European
Greece and Asia. That the Persians were
then possessed of a high degree of civilization is
proved by their political organization and financial
administration, by the magnificent ruins which
still attest the splendor and grandeur of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
cities. But the principles of government and religion,
the modes and habits of life, the genius of
the arts, were very differently understood by the
two nations; and, therefore, notwithstanding their
constant intercourse, neither made the slightest
approach toward assimilation with the other.
The Greeks called their puissant neighbors barbarians,
and the latter, no doubt, amply returned
the compliment.</p>

<p>In Ecbatana no other form of government could
be conceived than an undivided hereditary authority,
limited only by certain religious prescriptions
and a court ceremonial. The genius of the Greeks
tended to an endless variety of governmental forms;
subdivided into a number of petty sovereignties.
Greek society presented a singular mosaic of political
structures; oligarchical in Sparta, democratical
in Athens, tyrannical in Sicyon, monarchical in
Macedonia, the forms of government were the same
in scarcely two cities or districts. The state religion
of the Persians evinced the same tendency to unity
as their politics, and was more of a metaphysical and
moral than a material character. The Greeks, on
the contrary, had a symbolical system of religion,
consisting in the worship of natural objects and
influences, which gradually changed into a perfect
prosopop&oelig;ia, representing the gods as sentient<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
beings, subject to the same passions, and engaged
in the same pursuits and occupations as the inhabitants
of the earth. The worship consisted
principally in the performance of rites and demonstrations
of respect to the deities; the conscience
was left to the direction of the civil laws. Besides,
the rites, as well as the divinities and heroes in
whose honor they were practised, were different
in every place.</p>

<p>As for the manners and habits of life, it is unnecessary
to point out how vastly different they
were from those of Persia. Public contempt
punished the young, wealthy, pleasure-loving cosmopolitan,
who attempted to live in Persian style.
Thus, until the time of Alexander, when the power
of Greece had arrived at its culminating point,
Persia, with all her preponderance, could not convert
Hellas to her civilization.</p>

<p>In the time of Alexander, this incompatibility of
dissimilar modes of culture was singularly demonstrated.
When the empire of Darius succumbed
to the Macedonian phalanxes, it was expected, for
a time, that a Hellenic civilization would spread
over Asia. There seemed the more reason for
this belief when the conqueror, in a moment of
aberrancy, treated the monuments of the land
with such aggressive violence as seemed to evince<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
equal hatred and contempt. But the wanton incendiary
of Persepolis soon changed his mind,
and so completely, that his design became apparent
to simply substitute himself in the room of
the dynasty of Ach&aelig;menes, and rule over Persia
like a Persian king, with Greece added to his
estates. Great as was Alexander's power, it was
insufficient for the execution of such a project.
His generals and soldiers could not brook to see
their commander assume the long flowing robes of
the eastern kings, surround himself with eunuchs,
and renounce the habits and manners of his native
land. Though after his death some of his successors
persisted in the same system, they were compelled
greatly to mitigate it. Where the population
consisted of a motley compound of Greeks,
Syrians, and Arabs, as in Egypt and the coast of
Asia Minor, a sort of compromise between the two
civilizations became thenceforth the normal state
of the country; but where the races remained
unmixed, the national manners were preserved.</p>

<p>In the latter periods of the Roman empire, the
two civilizations had become completely blended
in the whole East, including continental Greece;
but it was tinged more with the Asiatic than the
Greek tendencies, because the masses belonged
much more to the former element than to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
latter. Hellenic forms, it is true, still subsisted,
but it is not difficult to discover in the ideas of
those periods and countries the Oriental stock
upon which the scions of the Alexandrian school
had been engrafted. The respective influence of
the various elements was in strict proportion to
the quantity of blood; the intellectual preponderance
belonged to that which had contributed the
greatest share.</p>

<p>The same antagonism which I pointed out between
the intellectual culture of the Greeks and
that of the Persians, will be found to result from
the contact of all other widely different civilizations.
I shall mention but one more instance:
the relations between the Arab civilization<a name="FNanchor-181" id="FNanchor-181"></a><a href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a> and
our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428">[Pg 428]</a></span>There was a time when the arts and sciences,
the muses and their train, seemed to have forsaken<span class="pagenum" style="visibility:hidden"><a name="page429" id="page429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
their former abodes, to rally around the standard
of Mohammed. That our forefathers were not
blind to the excellencies of the Arab civilization
is proved by their sending their sons to the schools
of Cordova. But not a trace of the spirit of that
civilization has remained in Europe, save in those
countries which still retain a portion of Ishmaelitic
blood. Nor has the Arab civilization found a
more congenial soil in India over which, also, its
dominion extended. Like those portions of Europe
which were subjected to Moslem masters,
that country has preserved its own modes of thinking
intact.</p>

<p>But if the pressure of the Arab civilization, at
the time of its greatest splendor and our greatest
ignorance, could not affect the modes of thinking
of the races of Western Europe, neither can we,
at present, when the positions are reversed, affect
in the slightest degree the feeble remnants of that
once so flourishing civilization. Our action upon
these remnants is continuous&mdash;the pressure of our
intellectual activity upon them immense; we succeed
only in destroying, not in transforming or
remodelling.<a name="FNanchor-182" id="FNanchor-182"></a><a href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430">[Pg 430]</a></span>Yet this civilization was not even original, and
might, therefore, be supposed to have a less obstinate
vitality. The Arab nation, it is well known,
based its empire and its intellectual culture upon
fragments of races which it had aggregated by
the weight of the sword. A variegated compound
like the Islamitic populations, could not but develop
a civilization of an equally variegated character,
to which each ethnical element contributed its
share. These elements it is not difficult to determine
and point out.</p>

<p>The nucleus, around which aggregated those
countless multitudes, was a small band of valiant
warriors who unfurled in their native deserts the
standard of a new creed. They were not, before
Mohammed's time, a new or unknown people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
They had frequently come in contact with the
Jews and Phenicians, and had in their veins the
blood of both these nations. Taking advantage of
their favorable situation for commerce, they had
performed the carrier trade of the Red Sea, and
the eastern coast of Africa and India, for the most
celebrated nations of ancient times, the Jews and
the Phenicians, later still, for the Romans and
Persians. They had the same traditions in common
with the Shemitic and Hamitic families from
which they sprung.<a name="FNanchor-183" id="FNanchor-183"></a><a href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a> They had even taken an
active part in the political life of neighboring nations.
Under the Arsacides and the sons of Sassan,
some of their tribes exerted great influence in the
politics of the Persian empire. One of their adventurers<a name="FNanchor-184" id="FNanchor-184"></a><a href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a>
had become Emperor of Rome; one of
their princes protected the majesty of Rome against
a conqueror before whom the whole east trembled,
and shared the imperial purple with the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
sovereign;<a name="FNanchor-185" id="FNanchor-185"></a><a href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a> one of their cities had become, under
Zenobia, the centre and capital of a vast empire
that rivalled and even threatened Rome.<a name="FNanchor-186" id="FNanchor-186"></a><a href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433">[Pg 433]</a></span>It is evident, therefore, that the Arab nation
had never ceased, from the remotest antiquity, to
entertain intimate relations with the most powerful
and celebrated ancient societies. It had taken
part in their political and intellectual<a name="FNanchor-187" id="FNanchor-187"></a><a href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a> activity;
and it might not inappropriately be compared to a
body half-plunged into the water, and half exposed
to the sun, as it partook at the same time of an
advanced state of civilization and of complete
barbarism.</p>

<p>Mohammed invented the religion most conformable
to the ideas of a people, among whom idolatry
had still many zealous adherents, but where
Christianity, though having made numerous converts,
was losing favor on account of the endless
schisms and contentions of its followers.<a name="FNanchor-188" id="FNanchor-188"></a><a href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
religious dogma of the Koreishite prophet was a
skilful compromise between the various contending<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
opinions. It reconciled the Jewish dispensation
with the New Law better than could the Church
at that time, and thus solved a problem which had
disquieted the consciences of many of the earlier
Christians, and which, especially in the east, had
given rise to many heretical sects. This was in
itself a very tempting bait, and, besides, any theological
novelty had decided chances of success
among the Syrians and Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor-189" id="FNanchor-189"></a><a href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> Moreover, the
new religion appeared with sword in hand, which
in those times of schismatical propagandism seemed
a warrant of success more relied upon by the masses
to whom it addressed itself, than peaceful persuasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436">[Pg 436]</a></span>Thus arrayed, Islamism issued from its native
deserts. Arrogant, and possessed but in a very
slight degree of the inventive faculty, it developed
no civilization peculiar to itself, but it had adopted,
as far as it was capable of doing, the bastard Greco-Asiatic
civilization already extant. As its triumphant
banners progressed on the east and south of
the Mediterranean, it incorporated masses imbued
with the same tendencies and spirit. From each
of these it borrowed something. As its religious
dogmas were a patchwork of the tenets of the
Church, those of the Synagogue, and of the disfigured
traditions of Hedjaz and Yemen, so its
code of laws was a compound of the Persian and
the Roman, its science was Greco-Syrian<a name="FNanchor-190" id="FNanchor-190"></a><a href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> and Egyptian,
its administration from the beginning tolerant
like that of every body politic that embraces many
heterogeneous elements.</p>

<p>It has caused much useless surprise, that Moslem
society should have made such rapid strides to
refinement of manners. But the mass of the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437">[Pg 437]</a></span>over whom its dominion extended, had merely
changed the name of their creed; they were old
and well-known actors on the stage of history, and
have simply been mistaken for a new nation when
they undertook to play the part of apostles before
the world. These people gave to the common
store their previous refinement and luxury; each
new addition to the standard of Islamism, contributed
some portion of its acquisitions. The vitalizing
principle of the society, the motive power of
this cumbrous mass, was the small nucleus of Arab
tribes that had come forth from the heart of the
peninsula. They furnished, not artists and learned
men, but fanatics, soldiers, victors, and masters.</p>

<p>The Arab civilization, then, is nothing but
the Greco-Syrian civilization, rejuvenated and
quickened, for a time, with a new and energetic,
but short-lived, genius. It was, besides, a little
renovated and a little modified, by a slight dash of
Persian civilization.</p>

<p>Yet, motley and incongruous as are the elements
of which it is composed, and capable of stretching
and accommodating itself as such a compound
must be, it cannot adapt itself to any social structure
erected by other elements than its own. In
other words, many as are the races that contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
to its formation, it is suited to none that have <em>not</em>
contributed to it.</p>

<p>This is what the whole course of history teaches
us. Every race has its own modes of thinking;
every race, capable of developing a civilization,
develops one peculiar to itself, and which it cannot
engraft upon any other, except by amalgamation
of blood, and then in but a modified degree.
The European cannot win the Asiatic to his modes
of thinking; he cannot civilize the Australian, or
the Negro; he can transmit but a portion of his
intelligence to his half-breed offspring of the inferior
race; the progeny of that half-breed and the
nobler branch of his ancestry, is but one degree
nearer, but not equal to that branch in capacity:
the proportions of blood are strictly preserved. I
have adduced illustrations of this truth from the
history of various branches of the human family,
of the lowest as well as of the higher in the scale
of intellectual progress. Are we not, then, authorized
to conclude that the diversity observable
among them is constitutional, innate, and not the
result of accident or circumstances&mdash;that there is
an absolute inequality in their intellectual endowments?</p>

<p class="center">MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE THREE GREAT VARIETIES.</p>

<div class="chapdesc"><p>Impropriety of drawing general conclusions from individual
cases&mdash;Recapitulatory sketch of the leading features of the
Negro, the Yellow, and the White races&mdash;Superiority of the
latter&mdash;Conclusion of volume the first.</p></div>


<p>In the preceding pages, I have endeavored to
show that, though there are both scientific and
religious reasons for not believing in a plurality
of origins of our species, the various branches of
the human family are distinguished by permanent
and irradicable differences, both mentally and physically.
They are unequal in intellectual capacity,<a name="FNanchor-191" id="FNanchor-191"></a><a href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440">[Pg 440]</a></span>in personal beauty, and in physical strength.
Again I repeat, that in coming to this conclusion,
I have totally eschewed the method which is, unfortunately
for the cause of science, too often resorted
to by ethnologists, and which, to say the
least of it, is simply ridiculous. The discussion
has not rested upon the moral and intellectual
worth of isolated individuals.</p>

<p>With regard to moral worth, I have proved
that all men, to whatever race they may belong,
are capable of receiving the lights of true religion,
and of sufficiently appreciating that blessing to
work out their own salvation. With regard to
intellectual capacity, I emphatically protest against
that mode of arguing which consists in saying,
"every negro is a dunce;" because, by the same
logic, I should be compelled to admit that "every
white man is intelligent;" and I shall take good
care to commit no such absurdity.</p>

<p>I shall not even wait for the vindicators of the
absolute equality of all races, to adduce to me
such and such a passage in some missionary's or
navigator's journal, wherefrom it appears that some
Yolof has become a skilful carpenter, that some
Hottentot has made an excellent domestic, that
some Caffre plays well on the violin, or that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Bambarra has made very respectable progress in
arithmetic.</p>

<p>I am prepared to admit&mdash;and to admit without
proof&mdash;anything of that sort, however remarkable,
that may be related of the most degraded
savages. I have already denied the excessive
stupidity, the incurable idiotcy of even the
lowest on the scale of humanity. Nay, I go
further than my opponents, and am not in the least
disposed to doubt that, among the chiefs of the
rude negroes of Africa, there could be found a
considerable number of active and vigorous minds,
greatly surpassing in fertility of ideas and mental
resources, the average of our peasantry, and even
of some of our middle classes. But the unfairness
of deductions based upon a comparison of the
most intelligent blacks and the least intelligent
whites, must be obvious to every candid mind.</p>

<p>Once for all, such arguments seem to me unworthy
of real science, and I do not wish to place
myself upon so narrow and unsafe a ground. If
Mungo Park, or the brothers Lander, have given
to some negro a certificate of superior intelligence,
who will assure us that another traveller, meeting
the same individual, would not have arrived
at a diametrically opposite conclusion concerning
him? Let us leave such puerilities, and compare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
not the individuals, but the masses. When we
shall have clearly established of what the latter
are capable, by what tendencies they are characterized,
and by what limits their intellectual activity
and development are circumscribed, whether, since
the beginning of the historic epoch, they have
acted upon, or been acted upon by other groups&mdash;when
we shall have clearly established these points,
we may then descend to details, and, perhaps, one
day be able to decide why the greatest minds of
one group are inferior to the most brilliant geniuses
of another, in what respects the vulgar herds of
all types assimilate, and in what others they differ,
and why. But this difficult and delicate task cannot
be accomplished until the relative position of
the whole mass of each race shall have been
nicely, and, so to say, mathematically defined. I
do not know whether we may hope ever to arrive
at results of such incontestable clearness and precision,
as to be able to no longer trust solely to
general facts, but to embrace the various shades
of intelligence in each group, to define and class
the inferior strata of every population and their
influence on the activity of the whole. Were it
possible thus to divide each group into certain
strata, and compare these with the corresponding
strata of every other: the most gifted of the dominant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443">[Pg 443]</a></span>with the most gifted of the dominated races,
and so on downwards, the superiority of some in
capacity, energy, and activity would be self-demonstrated.</p>

<p>After having mentioned the facts which prove
the inequality of various branches of the human
family, and having laid down the method by which
that proof should be established, I arrived at the
conclusion that the whole of our species is divisible
into three great groups, which I call primary
varieties, in order to distinguish them from others
formed by intermixture. It now remains for me
to assign to each of these groups the principal
characteristics by which it is distinguished from
the others.</p>

<p>The dark races are the lowest on the scale. The
shape of the pelvis has a character of animalism,
which is imprinted on the individuals of that race
ere their birth, and seems to portend their destiny.
The circle of intellectual development of that group
is more contracted than that of either of the two
others.</p>

<p>If the negro's narrow and receding forehead
seems to mark him as inferior in reasoning capacity,
other portions of his cranium as decidedly
point to faculties of an humbler, but not the less
powerful character. He has energies of a not despicable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444">[Pg 444]</a></span>order, and which sometimes display themselves
with an intensity truly formidable. He is
capable of violent passions, and passionate attachments.
Some of his senses have an acuteness unknown
to the other races: the sense of taste, and
that of smell, for instance.</p>

<p>But it is precisely this development of the animal
faculties that stamps the negro with the mark
of inferiority to other races. I said that his sense
of taste was acute; it is by no means fastidious.
Every sort of food is welcome to his palate; none
disgusts<a name="FNanchor-192" id="FNanchor-192"></a><a href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> him; there is no flesh nor fowl too vile<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
to find a place in his stomach. So it is with regard
to odor. His sense of smell might rather be called
greedy than acute. He easily accommodates himself
to the most repulsive.</p>

<p>To these traits he joins a childish instability of
humor. His feelings are intense, but not enduring.
His grief is as transitory as it is poignant, and he
rapidly passes from it to extreme gayety. He is
seldom vindictive&mdash;his anger is violent, but soon
appeased. It might almost be said that this variability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446">[Pg 446]</a></span>of sentiments annihilates for him the existence
of both virtue and vice. The very ardency
to which his sensibilities are aroused, implies a
speedy subsidence; the intensity of his desire, a
prompt gratification, easily forgotten. He does not
cling to life with the tenacity of the whites. But
moderately careful of his own, he easily sacrifices
that of others, and kills, though not absolutely
bloodthirsty, without much provocation or subsequent
remorse.<a name="FNanchor-193" id="FNanchor-193"></a><a href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a> Under intense suffering, he exhibits
a moral cowardice which readily seeks refuge
in death, or in a sort of monstrous impassivity.<a name="FNanchor-194" id="FNanchor-194"></a><a href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447">[Pg 447]</a></span>With regard to his moral capacities, it may be
stated that he is susceptible, in an eminent degree,
of religious emotions; but unless assisted by the
light of the Gospel, his religious sentiments are of
a decidedly sensual character.</p>

<p>Having demonstrated the little intellectual and
strongly sensual<a name="FNanchor-195" id="FNanchor-195"></a><a href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> character of the black variety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
as the type of which I have taken the negro of
Western Africa, I shall now proceed to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
the moral and intellectual characteristics of the
second in the scale&mdash;the yellow.</p>

<p>This seems to form a complete antithesis to
the former. In them, the skull, instead of being
thrown backward, projects. The forehead is large,
often jutting out, and of respectable height. The
facial conformation is somewhat triangular, but
neither chin nor nose has the rude, animalish
development that characterizes the negro. A
tendency to obesity is not precisely a specific
feature, but it is more often met with among the
yellow races than among any others. In muscular
vigor, in intensity of feelings and desires, they are
greatly inferior to the black. They are supple and
agile, but not strong. They have a decided taste
for sensual pleasures, but their sensuality is less
violent, and, if I may so call it, more vicious than
the negro's, and less quickly appeased. They
place a somewhat greater value upon human life
than the negro does, but they are more cruel for
the sake of cruelty. They are as gluttonous as
the negro, but more fastidious in their choice of
viands, as is proved by the immoderate attention
bestowed on the culinary art among the more
civilized of these races. In other words, the yellow
races are less impulsive than the black. Their
will is characterized by obstinacy rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
energetic violence; their anger is vindictive
rather than clamorous; their cruelty more studied
than passionate; their sensuality more refinedly
vicious than absorbing. They are, therefore, seldom
prone to extremes. In morals, as in intellect,
they display a mediocrity: they are given to grovelling
vices rather than to dark crimes; when
virtuous, they are so oftener from a sense of practical
usefulness than from exalted sentiments. In
regard to intellectual capacity, they easily understand
whatever is not very profound, nor very
sublime; they have a keen appreciation of the
useful and practical, a great love of quiet and
order, and even a certain conception of a slight
modicum of personal or municipal liberty. The
yellow races are practical people in the narrowest
sense of the word. They have little scope of
imagination, and therefore invent but little: for
great inventions, even the most exclusively utilitarian,
require a high degree of the imaginative
faculty. But they easily understand and adopt
whatever is of practical utility. The <i>summum
bonum</i> of their desires and aspirations is to pass
smoothly and quietly through life.</p>

<p>It is apparent from this sketch, that they are
superior to the blacks in aptitude and intellectual
capacity. A theorist who would form some model<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
society, might wish such a population to form the
substratum upon which to erect his structure; but
a society, composed entirely of such elements,
would display neither great stamina nor capacity
for anything great and exalted.</p>

<p>We are now arrived at the third and last of the
"primary" varieties&mdash;the white. Among them we
find great physical vigor and capacity of endurance;
an intensity of will and desire, but which
is balanced and governed by the intellectual faculties.
Great things are undertaken, but not blindly,
not without a full appreciation of the obstacles to
be overcome, and with a systematic effort to overcome
them. The utilitarian tendency is strong,
but is united with a powerful imaginative faculty,
which elevates, ennobles, idealizes it. Hence, the
power of invention; while the negro can merely
imitate, the Chinese only utilize, to a certain extent,
the practical results attained by the white,
the latter is continually adding new ones to those
already gained. His capacity for combination of
ideas leads him perpetually to construct new facts
from the fragments of the old; hurries him along
through a series of unceasing modifications and
changes. He has as keen a sense of order as the
man of the yellow race, but not, like him, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
love of repose and inertia, but from a desire to
protect and preserve his acquisitions. At the
same time, he has an ardent love of liberty, which
is often carried to an extreme; an instinctive aversion
to the trammels of that rigidly formalistic
organization under which the Chinese vegetates
with luxurious ease; and he as indignantly rejects
the haughty despotism which alone proves a sufficient
restraint for the black races.</p>

<p>The white man is also characterized by a singular
love of life. Perhaps it is because he knows
better how to make use of it than other races, that
he attaches to it a greater value and spares it more
both in himself and in others. In the extreme of
his cruelty, he is conscious of his excesses; a sentiment
which it may well be doubted whether it
exist among the blacks. Yet though he loves life
better than other races, he has discovered a number
of reasons for sacrificing it or laying it down
without murmur. His valor, his bravery, are not
brute, unthinking passions, not the result of callousness
or impassivity: they spring from exalted,
though often erroneous, sentiments, the principal
of which is expressed by the word "honor." This
feeling, under a variety of names and applications,
has formed the mainspring of action of most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
white races since the beginning of historical times.
It accommodates itself to every mode of existence,
to every walk of life. It is as puissant in the
pulpit and at the martyr's stake, as on the field of
battle; in the most peaceful and humble pursuits
of life as in the highest and most stirring. It were
impossible to define all the ideas which this word
comprises; they are better felt than expressed.
But this feeling&mdash;we might call it instinctive&mdash;is
unknown to the yellow, and unknown to the black
races: while in the white it quickens every noble
sentiment&mdash;the sense of justice, liberty, patriotism,
love, religion&mdash;it has no name in the language, no
place in the hearts, of other races. This I consider
as the principal reason of the superiority of our
branch of the human family over all others; because
even in the lowest, the most debased of our
race, we generally find some spark of this redeeming
trait, and however misapplied it may often be,
and certainly is, it prevents us, even in our deepest
errors, from falling so fearfully low as the others.
The extent of moral abasement in which we find so
many of the yellow and black races is absolutely
impossible even to the very refuse of our society.
The latter may equal, nay, surpass them in crime;
but even they would shudder at that hideous abyss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
of corrosive vices, which opens before the friend of
humanity on a closer study of these races.<a name="FNanchor-196" id="FNanchor-196"></a><a href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a></p>

<p>Before concluding this picture, I would add that
the immense superiority of the white races in all
that regards the intellectual faculties, is joined to
an inferiority as strikingly marked, in the intensity
of sensations. Though his whole structure is more
vigorous, the white man is less gifted in regard to
the perfection of the senses than either the black
or the yellow, and therefore less solicited and less
absorbed by animal gratifications.</p>

<p class="tbreak">I have now arrived at the historical portion of
my subject. There I shall place the truths
enounced in this volume in a clearer light, and
furnish irrefragable proofs of the fact, which forms
the basis of my theory, that nations degenerate
only in consequence and in proportion to their
admixture with an inferior race&mdash;that a society
receives its death-blow when, from the number of
diverse ethnical elements which it comprises, a
number of diverse modes of thinking and interests
contend for predominance; when these modes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
of thinking, and these interests have arisen in
such multiplicity that every effort to harmonize
them, to make them subservient to some great
purpose, is in vain; when, therefore, the only
natural ties that can bind large masses of men,
homogeneity of thoughts and feelings, are severed,
the only solid foundation of a social structure
sapped and rotten.</p>

<p>To furnish the necessary details for this assertion,
to remove the possibility of even the slightest
doubt, I shall take up separately, every great
and independent civilization that the world has
seen flourish. I shall trace its first beginnings, its
subsequent stages of development, its decadence
and final decay. Here, then, is the proper test of
my theory; here we can see the laws that govern
ethnical relations in full force on a magnificent
scale; we can verify their inexorably uniform and
rigorous application. The subject is immense, the
panorama spread before us the grandest and most
imposing that the philosopher can contemplate,
for its tableaux comprise the scene of action of
every instance where man has really worked out
his mission "to have dominion over the earth."</p>

<p>The task is great&mdash;too great, perhaps, for any
one's undertaking. Yet, on a more careful investigation,
many of the apparently insuperable difficulties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456">[Pg 456]</a></span>which discouraged the inquirer will vanish;
in the gorgeous succession of scenes that meet his
glance, he will perceive a uniformity, an intimate
relation and connection which, like Ariadne's
thread, will enable the undaunted and persevering
student to find his way through the mazes of the
labyrinth: we shall find that every civilization
owes its origin, its development, its splendors, to
the agency of the white races. In China and in
India, in the vast continent of the West, centuries
ere Columbus found it&mdash;it was one of the group
of white races that gave the impetus, and, so long
as it lasted, sustained it. Startling as this assertion
may appear to a great number of readers,
I hope to demonstrate its correctness by incontrovertible
historical testimony. Everywhere the
white races have taken the initiative, everywhere
they have <em>brought</em> civilization to the others&mdash;everywhere
they have sown the seed: the vigor
and beauty of the plant depended on whether the
soil it found was congenial or not.</p>

<p>The migrations of the white race, therefore,
afford us at once a guide for our historical researches,
and a clue to many apparently inexplicable
mysteries: we shall learn to understand why,
in a vast country, the development of civilization
has come to a stand, and been superseded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
retrogressive movement; why, in another, all but
feeble traces of a high state of culture has vanished
without apparent cause; why people, the lowest
in the scale of intellect, are yet found in possession
of arts and mechanical processes that would do
honor to a highly intellectual race.</p>

<p>Among the group of white races, the noblest,
the most highly gifted in intellect and personal
beauty, the most active in the cause of civilization,
is the Arian<a name="FNanchor-197" id="FNanchor-197"></a><a href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a> race. Its history is intimately associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page458" id="page458">[Pg 458]</a></span>with almost every effort on the part of man
to develop his moral and intellectual powers.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to trace out the field of
inquiry into which I propose to enter in the succeeding
volumes. The list of great, independent
civilizations is not long. Among all the innumerable
nations that "strutted their brief hour on the
stage" of the world, ten only have arrived at the
state of complete societies, giving birth to distinct
modes of intellectual culture. All the others
were imitators or dependents; like planets they
revolved around, and derived their light from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page459" id="page459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
suns of the systems to which they belonged. At
the head of my list I would place:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Indian civilization. It spread among
the islands of the Indian Ocean, towards the north,
beyond the Himalaya Mountains, and towards
the east, beyond the Brahmapootra. It was originated
by a white race of the Arian stock.</p>

<p>2. The Egyptian civilization comes next. As
its satellites may be mentioned the less perfect
civilizations of the Ethiopians, Nubians, and several
other small peoples west of the oasis of Ammon.
An Arian colony from India, settled in the
upper part of the Nile valley, had established this
society.</p>

<p>3. The Assyrians, around whom rallied the
Jews, Phenicians, Lydians, Carthaginians, and Hymiarites,
were indebted for their social intelligence
to the repeated invasions of white populations.
The Zoroastrian Iranians, who flourished in Further
Asia, under the names of Medes, Persians,
and Bactrians, were all branches of the Arian
family.</p>

<p>4. The Greeks belonged to the same stock, but
were modified by Shemitic elements, which, in
course of time, totally transformed their character.</p>

<p>5. China presents the precise counterpart of
Egypt. The light of civilization was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="page460" id="page460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
thither by Arian colonies. The substratum of the
social structure was composed of elements of the
yellow race, but the white civilizers received reinforcements
of their blood at various times.</p>

<p>6. The ancient civilization of the Italian peninsula
(the Etruscan civilization), was developed by
a mosaic of populations of the Celtic, Iberian, and
Shemitic stock, but cemented by Arian elements.
From it emerged the civilization of Rome.</p>

<p>7. Our civilization is indebted for its tone and
character to the Germanic conquerors of the fifth
century. They were a branch of the Arian family.</p>

<p>8, 9, 10. Under these heads I class the three
civilizations of the western continent, the Alleghanian,
the Mexican, and the Peruvians.</p>

<p>This is the field I have marked out for my investigations,
the results of which will be laid before
the reader in the succeeding volumes. The first
part of my work is here at an end&mdash;the vestibule
of the structure I wish to erect is completed.</p>

<p>I have seldom perused a work which has afforded
me so much pleasure and instruction as the
one of Count Gobineau, "<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sur l'In&eacute;galit&eacute; des Races
Humaines</cite>," and regard most of his conclusions as
incontrovertible. There are, however, a few points
in his argument which should not be passed without
comment, and others not sufficiently elaborated.
My original intention was to say much, but, fortunately
for me, my colleague, Mr. Hotz, has so
fully and ably anticipated me, in his Introduction
and Notes, as to leave me little of importance to
add.</p>

<p>The essay of Count Gobineau is eminently practical
and useful in its design. He views the
various races of men rather as a historian than
a naturalist, and while he leaves open the long
mooted question of <em>unity</em> of origin, he so fully
establishes the <em>permanency</em> of the actual moral,
intellectual, and physical diversities of races as to
leave no ground for antagonists to stand upon.
Whatever <em>remote causes</em> may be assigned, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
no appeal from the conclusion that white, black,
Mongol, and other races were fully developed in
nations some 3000 years before Christ, and that
no physical causes, during this long course of time,
have been in operation, to change one type of man
into another. Count Gobineau, therefore, accepts
the <em>existing</em> diversity of races as at least an <em>accomplished
fact</em>, and draws lessons of wisdom from the
plain teachings of history. Man with him ceases
to be an abstraction; each race, each nation, is
made a separate study, and a fertile but unexplored
field is opened to our view.</p>

<p>Our author leans strongly towards a belief in
the <em>original diversity</em> of races, but has evidently
been much embarrassed in arriving at conclusions
by religious scruples and by the want of accurate
knowledge in that part of natural history which
treats of the designation of <em>species</em>, and the laws of
<em>hybridity</em>; he has been taught to believe that two
distinct species cannot produce perfectly prolific
offspring, and therefore concludes that all races of
men <em>must</em> be of one origin, because they are prolific
<i>inter se</i>. My appendix will therefore be devoted
mainly to this question of species.</p>

<p>Our author has taken the facts of Dr. Morton at
second hand, and, moreover, had not before him Dr.
Morton's later tables and more matured deductions;
I shall therefore give an abstract of his results as
published by himself in 1849, with some comments of
my own. The figures represent the internal capacity
of the skull in cubic inches, and were obtained by filling
the cavity with shot and afterwards pouring them
into an accurately graduated measure.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the collection of Morton is
not sufficiently full in all its departments to enable
us to arrive at the absolute capacity of crania in the
different races; but it is sufficiently complete to establish
beyond cavil, the fact that the crania of the white
are much larger than those of the dark races. His
table is very incomplete in Mongol, Malays, and some
others; but in the white races of Europe, the black
races, and the American, the results are substantially
correct. I have myself had ample opportunities for
examining the heads of living negroes and Indians of
America, as well as a considerable number of crania,
and can fully indorse Dr. Morton's results. It will be
seen that his skulls of American aborigines amount to
338.</p>

Dr. Morton's mind, it will be seen by this table,
had not yet freed itself from the incubus of artificial
and unnatural classifications. Like Tiedemann and
others, he has grouped together races which have not
the slightest affinity in physical, moral, or linguistic
characters. In the <em>Caucasian</em> group, for example,
are placed the Teutonic, Indostanic, Shemitic, and Nilotic
families, each of which, it can be shown, has
existed utterly distinct for 5000 years, not to mention
many subdivisions.</p>

<p>The table of Dr. Morton affords some curious results.
His ancient Pelasgic heads and those of the modern
white races, give the same size of brain, viz: 88 cubic
inches; and his ancient Egyptians and their modern
representatives, the Fellahs, yield the same mean, 80
cubic inches; the difference between the two groups
being 8 cubic inches. These facts have a strong
bearing on the question of <em>permanence</em> of types. The
small-headed Hindoos present the same cranial capacity
as the Egyptians, and though these races have each
been the repository of early civilization, it is a question
whether either was the originator of civilization. The
Egyptian race, from the earliest monumental dawn,
exhibits Shemitic adulteration; and Latham proves that
the Sanscrit language was not indigenous to India, but
was carried there from Northern Europe in early ages
by conquerors.</p>

<p>Again, in the negro group, while it is absolutely
shown that certain African races, whether born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Africa, or of the tenth descent in America, give a
cranial capacity almost identical, 83 cubic inches; we
see, on the contrary, the Hottentot and Australian
yielding a mean of but 75 inches, thereby showing a
like difference of eight cubic inches.</p>

<p>In the American group, also, the same parallel holds
good. The Toltecan family, the most civilized race,
exhibit a mean of but 77 inches, while the barbarous
tribes give 84, that is, a difference of 7 inches in favor
of the savage. While, however, the Toltecans have
the smaller heads, they are, according to Combe, much
more developed in the anterior or <em>intellectual</em> lobes,
which may serve to explain this apparent paradox.</p>

<p>When we compare the highest and lowest races with
each other, the contrast becomes still more striking,
viz: the Teutonic with the Hottentot and Australian.
The former family gives a mean capacity of 92 inches,
while the latter two yield but 75, or a difference of <em>17
cubic inches</em> between the skulls of these types!</p>

<p>Now, as far back as history and monuments carry us,
as well as crania and other testimonies, these various
types have been <em>permanent</em>; and most of them we can
trace back several thousand years. If such permanence
of type through thousands of years, and in defiance of
all climatic influences, does not establish <em>specific</em> characters,
then is the naturalist at sea without a compass
to guide him.</p>

<p>These facts determine clearly the arbitrary nature of
all classifications heretofore adopted; the Teuton, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page469" id="page469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
Jew, the Hindoo, the Egyptian, &amp;c., have all been
included under the term <em>Caucasian</em>; and yet they have,
as far as we know, been through all time as distinct
in physical and moral characters from each other, as
they have from the negro races of Africa and Oceanica.
The same diversity of types is found among all the
other groups, or arbitrary divisions of the human family.</p>

<p>Rich and rare as is the collection of Dr. Morton, it
is very defective in many of its divisions, and it occurred
to me that this deficiency might to some degree be supplied
by the hat manufacturers of various nations;
notwithstanding that the information derived from this
source could give but one measurement, viz: the <em>horizontal
periphery</em>. Yet this one measurement alone, on
an extended scale, would go far towards determining
the general size of the brain. I accordingly applied to
three hat dealers in Mobile, and a large manufacturer
in New Jersey, for statements of the relative number of
hats of each size sold to adult males; their tables agree
so perfectly as to leave no doubt as to the circumference
of the heads of the white population of the
United States. The three houses together dispose of
about 15,000 hats annually.</p>

<p>The following table was obligingly sent me by
Messrs. Vail &amp; Yates, of Newark; and they accompanied
it with the remark, that their hats were sent
principally to our Western States, where there is a
large proportion of German population; also that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page470" id="page470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
sizes of these hats were a little larger (about one fourth
of an inch) than those sold in the Southern States.
This remark was confirmed by the three dealers in
Mobile. Our table gives, 1st. The number or size of
the hat. 2d. The circumference of the head corresponding.
3d. The circumference of the hat; and lastly, the
relative proportion of each No. sold out of 12 hats.</p>

<p>All hats larger than these are called "extra sizes."</p>

<p>The average size, then, of the crania of white races
in the United States, is about 22&frac12; inches circumference,
including the hair and scalp, for which about
1&frac12; inches should be deducted, leaving a mean horizontal
periphery, for adult males, of 21 inches. The
measurements of the purest Teutonic races in Germany
and other countries, would give a larger mean; and I
have reason to believe that the population of France,
which is principally Celtic, would yield a smaller mean.
I hope that others will extend these observations.</p>

<p>Dr. Morton's measurements of aboriginal American
races, give a mean of but 19&frac12; inches; and this statement
is greatly strengthened by the fact that the
Mexicans and other Indian races wear much smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="page471" id="page471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
hats than our white races. (See <cite>Types of Mankind</cite>, p.
289 and 453.)</p>

<p>Prof. Tiedemann, of Heidelberg, asserts that the head
of the negro is as large as that of the white man, but
this we have shown to be an error. (<cite>Types of Mankind</cite>,
p. 453.)</p>

<p>Tiedemann adopted the vulgar error of grouping
together under the term <em>Caucasian</em>, all the Indo-Germanic,
Shemitic, and Nilotic races; also all the black
and dark races of Africa under the term <em>Negro</em>. Now
I have shown that the Hindoo and Egyptian races
possess about 12 cubic inches less of brain than the
Teutonic; and the Hottentots about 8 inches less than
the Negro proper. I affirm that no valid reason has
ever been assigned why the Teuton and Hindoo, or
Hottentot and Negro, should be classed together in
their cranial measurements. I can discover no facts
which can assign a greater age to one of these races
than another; and unless Professor Tiedemann can
overcome these difficulties, he has no right to assume
identity for the various races he is pleased to group
under each of his arbitrary divisions. Mummies from
the catacombs, and portraits on the monuments, show
that the heads of races on both sides of the Red Sea
have remained unchanged 4000 years.</p>

<p>As Dr. Morton tabulated his skulls on the same
arbitrary basis, I abandon his arrangement and present
his facts as they stand in nature, allowing the reader to
compare and judge for himself. The following table<span class="pagenum"><a name="page472" id="page472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
gives the <em>internal capacity</em> in cubic inches, and it will be
seen that the measurements arrange themselves in a
sliding scale of 17 cubic inches from the Teuton down
to the Hottentot and Australian.</p>

<p>Such has been, through several thousand years, the
incessant commingling of races, that we are free to
admit that absolute accuracy in measurements of crania
cannot now be attained. Yet so constant are the
results in contrasting groups, that no unprejudiced
mind can deny that there is a wide and well-marked
disparity in the cranial developments of races.</p>

<p>As the discussion stands at the present day, we may
assume that the scientific world is pretty equally divided
on the question of unity of the human family,
and the point is to be settled by facts, and not by
names. Natural history is a comparatively new and
still rapidly progressing science, and the study of man
has been one of the last departments to attract serious
attention. Blumenbach and Prichard, who may be
regarded among the early explorers in this vast field,
have but recently been numbered with the dead; and
we may safely assert that the last ten years have
brought forth materials which have shed an entirely new
light on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Agassiz, Dr. Morton, Prof. Leidy, and many
other naturalists of the United States, contend for an
original diversity in the races of men, and we shall
proceed to give some of the reasons why we have
adopted similar views. Two of the latest writers of
any note on the opposite side are the Rev. Dr. Bachman,
of Charleston, and M. Flourens, of Paris; and
as these gentlemen have very fully travelled over the
argument opposed to us, we shall take the liberty,
in the course of our remarks, to offer some objections
to their views.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in this discussion is, to define<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
clearly what meaning should be attached to the term
<em>species</em>; and to the illustration of this point, mainly,
will our labors be confined. <em>Genera</em> are, for the most
part, well defined by <em>anatomical</em> characters, and little
dispute exists respecting them; but no successful attempt
has yet been made to designate <em>species</em> in this
way, and it is by their <em>permanency of type alone</em>, as
ascertained from written or monumental records, that
our decision can be guided.</p>


<h4>SPECIES.</h4>

<p>The following definitions of species have been selected
by Dr. Bachman, and may be received as unexceptionable
as any others; but we shall show that they
fall far short of the true difficulties of the case.</p>

<blockquote><p>"We are under the necessity of admitting the existence of
certain forms, which have perpetuated themselves, from the
beginning of the world, without exceeding the limits prescribed:
all the individuals belonging to one of these forms constitute a
<em>species</em>."&mdash;<cite class="author">Cuvier.</cite></p>

<p>"We unite under the designation species all those individuals
who mutually bear to each other so close a resemblance as to
allow of our supposing that they may have proceeded originally
from a single being, or a single pair."&mdash;<cite class="author">De Candolle.</cite></p>

<p>"The name species is applied to an assemblage of individuals
which bear a strong resemblance to each other, and which are
perpetuated with the same essential qualities. Thus man, the
dog, the horse, constitute to the zoologist so many distinct species."&mdash;<cite class="author">Milne
Edwards</cite> and <cite class="author">Achille Compte</cite>.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have no objection to this definition, but the examples
cited are points in dispute, and not received by
many of the leading naturalists of the day.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page475" id="page475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
"Species are fixed and permanent forms of being, exhibiting
indeed certain modes of variation, of which they may be more
or less susceptible, but maintaining throughout those modifications
a sameness of structural essentials, transmitted from generation
to generation, and never lost by the influence of causes
which otherwise produce obvious effects. <em>Varieties</em> are either
accidental or the result of the care and culture of man."<a name="FNanchor-198" id="FNanchor-198"></a><a href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a>&mdash;<cite class="author">Martin.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Bachman gives another, substantially the same,
from Agassiz; and also one of his own, to which he
appends, as an additional test of species, the production
of "<em>fertile offspring by association</em>." In this definition
the doctor <em>assumes</em> one of the main points in
dispute.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<em>Varieties</em>," says Dr. Bachman, "are those that are produced
within the limits of particular species, and have not existed
from its origin. They sometimes originate in wild species, especially
those that have a wide geographical range, and are thus
exposed to change of climate and temperature," &amp;c. * * *
"<em>Permanent varieties</em> are such as, having once taken place, are
propagated in perpetuity, and do not change their characteristics
unless they breed with other varieties."</p></blockquote>

<p>We may remark that the existence of such <em>permanent
varieties</em> as here described is also in dispute.</p>

<p>The same author continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"On comparing these definitions, as given by various naturalists,
each in his own language, it will be perceived that there is
no essential difference in the various views expressed in regard
to the characters by which a species is designated. They all
regard it as 'the lowest term to which we descend, with the exception
of <em>varieties</em>, such as are seen in domestic animals.' They
are, to examine the external and internal organization of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page476" id="page476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
animal or plant&mdash;they are, to compare it with kindred species,
and if by this examination they are found to possess <em>permanent
characters differing from those of other species, it proves itself to be
a distinct species</em>. When this fact is satisfactorily ascertained, and
the specimen is not found a domestic species, in which varieties
always occur, presumptive evidence is afforded of its having had
a primordial existence. We infer this from the fact that no
species is the production of blind chance, and that within the
<em>knowledge of history</em> no true species, but <em>varieties</em> only, whose
origin can be <em>distinctly traced to existing and well-known species</em>,
have made their appearance in the world. This, then, is the
only means within the knowledge of man by which any species
of plant or animal <em>can be shown</em> to be primordial. The peculiar
form and characters designated the species, and its origin was a
necessary inference derived from the characters stamped on it
by the hand of the Creator."</p></blockquote>

<p>To all the positions thus far taken by Dr. Bachman,
we most cheerfully subscribe; they are strictly scientific,
and by such <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: Corrected typo 'criterea'">criteria</ins> alone do we desire to test the
unity of the human family; but we must enter a decided
demurrer to the assertion which follows, viz: that, "according
to the universally received definition of species,
all the individuals of the human race are proved to be
of one species." When it shall be shown that all the
races of men, dogs, horses, cattle, wolves, foxes, &amp;c.,
are "varieties only, <em>whose origin can be distinctly traced
to existing and well-known species</em>," we may then yield
the point; but we must be permitted to say that Dr.
Bachman is the only naturalist, as far as we know, who
has assumed to know these original types.</p>

<p>Now, if the reader will turn back and review carefully
all the definitions of species cited, he will perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
that they are not based upon <em>anatomical characters</em>, but
simply on the <em>permanency</em> of certain organic forms,
and that this permanence of form is determined by its
<em>history</em> alone.</p>

<p>Professor Owen, of London, has thrown the weight
of his great name into the scale, and tells us that "man
is the sole species of his genus, the sole representative
of his order." But proving that man is not a monkey,
as the professor has done in the lecture alluded to, does
not prove that men are all of <em>one</em> species, according to
any definition yet received: he has made the assertion,
but has assigned no scientific reasons to sustain it. No
one would be more rejoiced than ourselves, to see the
great talent and learning of Professor Owen brought
fully to bear on this point; but, like most naturalists,
he has overlooked one of the most important points in
this discussion&mdash;<em>the monumental history of man</em>.</p>

<p>Will Professor Owen or Dr. Bachman tell us wherein
the lion and tiger&mdash;the dog, wolf, fox, and jackal&mdash;the
fossil horse, and living species&mdash;the Siberian mammoth
and the Indian elephant, differ more from each other
than the white man and the negro? Are not all these
regarded by naturalists as distinct species, and yet who
pretends to be able to distinguish the skeleton of one
from the other by specific characters?</p>

<p>The examples just cited, of living species, have been
decided upon simply from their permanency of type, as
derived from their history; and we say that, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page478" id="page478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
same process of reasoning, the races of men depicted
on the monuments of Egypt, five thousand years ago,
and which have maintained their types through all time
and all climates since, are <em>distinct species</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. Morton defines species&mdash;"a primordial organic
form," and determines these forms by their permanence
through all human records; and Mr. Agassiz, who
adopts this definition, adds: "Species are thus distinct
forms of organic life, the origin of which is lost in the
primitive establishment of the state of things now existing;
and varieties are such modification of the species
as may return to the typical form under temporary
influences."</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman objects very strongly to this definition,
and declares it a "cunning device, and, to all intents,
an <i>ex post facto</i> law," suddenly conjured up during a
controversy, to avoid the difficulties of the case; but
we have serious doubts whether these gentlemen are
capable of such subterfuge in matters of science,
and confess that we cannot see any substantial difference
between their definition and those given by
Dr. Bachman. Morton and Agassiz determine a form
to be "<em>primordial</em>" by its permanency, as proved by
history, and the other definitions assign no other
test.</p>

<p>Professor Leidy, who has not only studied the "lower
departments of zoology," like Mr. Agassiz, but also
the "higher forms of animal life," says that "too<span class="pagenum"><a name="page479" id="page479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
much importance has been attached to the term species,"
and gives the following definition: "A species
of plant or animal may be defined to be an immutable
organic form, whose characteristic distinctions may
always be recognized by <em>a study of its history</em>."<a name="FNanchor-199" id="FNanchor-199"></a><a href="#Footnote-199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a></p>

<p>M. Jourdain, under the head "Esp&egrave;ce," in his <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dictionnaire
des Termes des Sciences Naturelles</cite>, after citing
a long list of definitions from leading authors, concludes
with the following remarks, which, as the question
now stands before the world, places the term species
just where it should be:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is evident that we can, among organized bodies, regard as
a <em>species</em> only such a collection of beings as resemble each other
more than they resemble others, and which, by a consent more
or less unanimous, it is agreed to designate by a common name;
for a <em>species</em> is but a simple <em>abstraction of the mind</em>, and not a
group, exactly determined by nature herself, as ancient as she
is, and of which she has irrevocably traced the limits. It is in
the definition of species that we recognize how far the influence
of ideas adopted without examination in youth is powerful in
obscuring the most simple ideas of general physics."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although not written with the expectation of publication,
I will take the liberty of publishing the following
private letter just received from Prof. Leidy. He
has not appeared at all in this controversy before the
public, and we may safely say that no one can be better
qualified than he is to express an opinion on this question
of species.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
"With all the contention about the question of what constitutes
a <em>species</em>, there appears to be almost no difficulty, comparatively,
in its practical recognition. Species of plants and animals
are daily determined, and the characters which are given to distinguish
them are viewed by the great body of naturalists as
sufficient. All the definitions, however, which have been given
for a species, are objectionable. Morton says: 'A species is a
primordial organic form.' But how shall we distinguish the
latter? How can it be proved that any existing forms primordially
were distinct? In my attempted definition, I think, I
fail, for I only direct how species are discovered.</p>

<p>"According to the practical determination of a species by
naturalists, in a late number of the <cite>Proceedings</cite> of our Academy
(vol. vii. p. 201), I observe: 'A species is a mere convenient
word with which naturalists empirically designate groups of
organized beings possessing characters of comparative constancy,
as far as historic experience has guided them in giving
due weight to such constancy.'</p>

<p>"According to this definition, the races of men are evidently
distinct species. But it may be said that the definition is given
to suit the circumstances. So it is, and so it should be; or, if
not, then all characterized species should conform to an arbitrary
definition. The species of gyp&aelig;tus, hali&aelig;tus, tanagra,
and of many other genera of birds, are no more distinguishable
than the species of men; and, I repeat, the anatomy of one
species of hali&aelig;tus, or of any other genus, will answer for that
of all the other species of the same genus. The same is the
case with mammals. One species of felis, ursus, or equus will
give the exact anatomy of all the other species in each genus,
just as you may study the anatomy of the white man upon the
black man. While Prof. Richard Owen will compare the orang
with man, and therefore deduce all races of the latter to be of
one species, he divides the genus cervus into several other
genera, and yet there is no difference in their internal anatomy;
while he considers the horse and the ass as two distinct genera,
and says that a certain fossil horse-tooth, carefully compared
with the corresponding tooth of the recent horse, showed no differences,
excepting in being a little more curved, he considers it
a distinct species, under the name of equus curvidens; and yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
with differences of greater value in the jaws of the negro and
white man, he considers them the same.</p>

<p>"In the restricted genera of vertebrata of modern naturalists,
the specific characters are founded on the external appendages,
for the most part&mdash;differences in the scales, horns, antlers,
feathers, hairs, or bills. Just as you separate the black and
white man by the difference in the color of the skin and the
character of the hair, so do we separate the species of bears, or
cats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<em class="smcap">Philadelphia</em>, <i>April 18, 1855</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>We might thus go on and multiply, to the extent of
an octavo volume, evidence to show how vague and unsettled
is the term species among naturalists, and that,
when we abandon historical records, we have no reliable
guide left. Moreover, were we able to establish perfectly
reliable landmarks between species, we still have
no means of determining whether they were originally
created in one pair, or many pairs. The latter is certainly
the most rational supposition: there is every
reason to believe that the earth and the sea brought
forth "<em>abundantly</em>" of each species.</p>

<p>It must be clear to the reader, from the evidence
above adduced, that Dr. Bachman claims far too much
when he asserts that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Naturalists can be found, in Europe and America, who,
without any <em>vain boast</em>, can distinguish every species of bird and
quadruped on their separate continents; and the characters
which distinguish and separate the several species are as distinct
and infallible as are those which form the genera."<a name="FNanchor-200" id="FNanchor-200"></a><a href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
And, again, when he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"From the opportunities we have enjoyed in the examination
of the varieties and species of domesticated quadrupeds and
birds, we have never found any difficulty in deciding on the species
to which these varieties belong."</p></blockquote>

<p>Those of us who are still groping in darkness certainly
have a right to ask who are the authorities
alluded to, and what are those "characters which distinguish
and separate species" as distinctly and infallibly
as "genera?" They are certainly not in print.</p>

<p>The doctor must pardon us for reminding him that
there is printed evidence that his own mind is not
always free from doubts. In the introduction of Audubon
and Bachman's <cite>Quadrupeds of America</cite>, p. vii.,
it is said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Although <em>genera</em> may be easily ascertained by the forms and
dental arrangements peculiar to each, many <em>species</em> so nearly
approach each other in size, while they are so variable in color,
that it is exceedingly difficult to separate them with positive
certainty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, in speaking of the genus <i>vulpes</i> (foxes), the
same work says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The characters of this genus differ so slightly from those of
the genus <i>canis</i>, that we are induced to pause before removing
it from the sub-genus in which it had so long remained. As a
general rule, we are obliged to <em>admit that a large fox is a wolf,
and a small wolf may be termed a fox</em>. So inconveniently large,
however, is the list of species in the old genus <i>canis</i>, that it is,
we think, advisable to separate into distinct groups such species
as possess any characters different from true wolves."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483">[Pg 483]</a></span>Speaking of the origin of the domestic dog, Dr. Bachman,
in his work on <cite>Unity of Races</cite>, p. 63, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding all these difficulties&mdash;and we confess we
are not free from some doubts in regard to their identity (dog
and wolf)&mdash;if we were called upon to decide on any wild species
as the progenitor of our dogs, we would sooner fix upon the
large wolf than on any other dog, hyena, or jackal," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The doctor is unable, here at least (and we can point
out many other cases), to "designate species;" and the
recent investigations of Flourens, at the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jardin des
Plantes</cite>, prove him wrong as regards the origin of the
dog. The dog is not derived from the "large wolf,"
but, with it, produces hybrids, sterile after the third
generation. The dog forms a genus apart.</p>

<p>We repeat, then, that in a large number of <em>genera</em>, the
species cannot be separated by any anatomical characters,
and that it is from their history alone naturalists
have arrived at those minute divisions now generally
received. We may, without the fear of contradiction,
go a step further, and assert that several of the races of
men are as widely separated in physical organization,
physiological and psychological characters, as are the
canid&aelig;, equid&aelig;, felines, elephants, bears and others.
When the white races of Europe, the Mongols of Asia,
the aborigines of America, the black races of Africa
and Oceanica are placed beside each other, they are
marked by stronger differences than are the species of
the genera above named. It has been objected that
these gaps are filled by intermediate links which make<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
the chain complete from one extremity to the other.
The admission of the fact does not invalidate our position,
for we have shown elsewhere (see <cite>Types of Mankind</cite>)
<em>gradation</em> is the law of nature. The extreme
types, we have proven, have been distinct for more than
5000 years, and no existing causes during that time
have transformed one type into another. The well-marked
negro type, for example, stands face to face
with the white type on the monuments of Egypt; and
they differ more from each other than the dog and
wolf, ass and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equis Hemionus</i>, lion and tiger, &amp;c.
The hair and skin, the size and shape of head, the
pelvis, the extremities, and other points, separate certain
African and Oceanican negroes more widely than the
above species. This will not be questioned, whatever
difference of opinion may exist with regard to the permanency
of these forms. In the language of Prof.
Leidy, "the question to be determined is, whether the
differences in the races of men are as permanent and of
as much value as those which characterize species in
the lower genera of animals." These races of men too
are governed by the same laws of geographical distribution,
as the species of the lower genera; they are
found, as far back as history can trace them, as widely
separated as possible, and surrounded by local Flor&aelig;
and Faun&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page485" id="page485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<h4>VARIETIES.</h4>

<p>This term is very conveniently introduced to explain
all the difficulties which embarrass this discussion.
Dr. Bachman insists that all the races of men are mere
<em>varieties</em>, and sustains the opinion by a repetition of
those analogies which have been so often drawn from
the animal kingdom by Prichard and his school. It
is well known that those animals which have been
domesticated undergo, in a few generations, very remarkable
changes in color, form, size, habits, &amp;c. For
example, all the hogs, black, white, brown, gray,
spotted, &amp;c., now found scattered over the earth, have,
it is said, their parentage in one pair of wild hogs.
"This being admitted," says Dr. B. "we invite the advocates
of plurality in the human species to show wherein
these varieties are less striking than their eight (alluding
to Agassiz) originally created nations." Again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"And how has the discovery been made that all the permanent
races are mere varieties, and not 'originally created'
species, or 'primitive varieties?' Simply because the naturalists
of Germany, finding that the original wild hog still exists
in their forests, have, in a thousand instances, reclaimed them
from the woods. By this means they have discovered that their
descendants, <em>after a few generations</em>, lose their ferocity, assume
all colors," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same reasoning is applied to horses, cattle,
goats, sheep, &amp;c., while many, if not most of the best
naturalists of the day deny that we know anything of
the origin of our domestic animals. Geoffroy St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page486" id="page486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
Hilaire, in his work, just out, denies it in toto. We
are, however, for the sake of argument, willing to
admit all the examples, and all he claims with regard
to the origin of endless varieties in domesticated
animals.<a name="FNanchor-201" id="FNanchor-201"></a><a href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a></p>

<p>Let us, on the other hand, "invite the advocates of
<em>unity</em> of the human species" to say when and where
such varieties have sprung up in the human family.
We not only have the written history of man for 2000
years, but his monumental history for 2000 more; and
yet, while the naturalists of Germany are catching wild
hogs, and recording in a thousand instances "after a
few generations" these wonderful changes, no one has
yet pointed out anything analogous in the human
family; the porcupine family in England, a few spotted
Mexicans, &amp;c., do not meet the case; history records
the origin of no permanent variety. No race of men
has in the same country turned black, brown, gray,
white, and spotted. The negroes in America have not
in ten generations turned to all colors, though fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
<em>domesticated</em>, like pigs and turkeys. The Jews in all
countries for 2000 years are still Jews. The gypsies
are everywhere still gypsies. In India, the different
castes, of different colors, have been living together
several thousand years, and are still distinct, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nor does domestication affect all animals and fowls
equally; compare the camel, ass, and deer, with the
hog and dog; the Guinea fowl, pea fowl, and goose,
with pigeons, turkeys, and common fowls. In fact, no
one animal can be taken as an analogue for another:
each has its own physiological laws; each is influenced
differently and in different degrees by the same external
influences. How, then, can an animal be taken as an
analogue for man?</p>

<p>We have also abundant authority to show that all
wild species do not present the same uniformity in external
characters.</p>

<blockquote><p>"All packs of American wolves usually consist of various
shades of color, and varieties nearly black have been occasionally
found in every part of the United States.... In
a gang of wolves which existed in Colleton District, South Carolina,
a few years ago (sixteen of which were killed by hunters
in eighteen months), we were informed that about one-fifth were
black, and the others of every shade of color, from black to
dusky gray and yellowish white."&mdash;<cite class="author">Audubon &amp; Bachman</cite>, 2d
Amer. ed., vol. ii. pp. 130-1.</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the white American wolf, the same
authors say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Their gait and movements are precisely the same as those
of the common dog, and their mode of copulating and number
of young brought forth at a litter, are about the same." (It might<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
have been added that their number of bones, teeth, whole anatomical
structure are the same.) "The diversity of their size
and color is remarkable, no two being quite alike."...
"The wolves of the prairies ... produce from six to eleven at
a birth, of which there are very seldom two alike in color."&mdash;<cite>Op.
cit.</cite>, p. 159.</p>

<p>"The common American wolf, Richardson observes, sometimes
shows remarkable diversity of color. On the banks of
the Mackenzie River I saw five young wolves leaping and tumbling
over each other with all the playfulness of the puppies of
the domestic dog, and it is not improbable they were all of one
litter. One of them was pied, another black, and the rest
showed the colors of the common gray wolves."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same diversity is seen in the prairie wolf, and
naturalists have been much embarrassed in classifying
the various wolves on account of colors, size, &amp;c.</p>

<p>All this is independent of <em>domestication</em>, and shows
the uncertainty of analogues; and still it is remarkable
that though considerable variety exists in the native
dogs of America in color and size, they do not run
into the thousand grotesque forms seen on the old
continent, where a much greater mixture exists. The
dogs of America, like the aboriginal races of men, are
comparatively uniform. In the East, where various
races have come together, the men, like the dogs, present
endless varieties, Egypt, Assyria, India, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that one variety of hog had been
discovered in Africa, one in Asia, one in Europe, one
in Australia, another in America, as well marked as
those Dr. B. describes; that these varieties had been
transferred to other climates as have been Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
gypsies, negroes, &amp;c., and had remained for ages
without change of form or color, would they be considered
as distinct species or not?&mdash;can any one doubt?
The rule must work both ways, or the argument falls to
the ground.</p>

<p>In fact the Dr. himself makes admissions which fully
refute his whole theory.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whilst," says he, "we are willing to allow some weight to
the argument advanced by President Smyth, who endeavors to
account for the varieties in man from the combined influences
of three causes, 'climate, the state of society, and manner of
living,' we are free to admit that it is impossible to account for
the varieties in the human family from the causes which he has
assigned."<a name="FNanchor-202" id="FNanchor-202"></a><a href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Dr. further admits, in the same work, that the
races have been <em>permanent</em> since the time of the old
Egyptian empire, and <em>supposes</em> that at some extremely
remote time, of which we have no record, that "they
were more susceptible of producing varieties than at a
later period." These suppositions answer a very good
purpose in theology, but do not meet the requirements
of science.</p>


<h4>HYBRIDITY.</h4>

<p>Having shown the insufficiency of all the other
arguments in establishing the landmarks of <em>species</em>, let
us now turn to those based on <em>hybridity</em>, which seems
to be the last stronghold of the unity party. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page490" id="page490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
point hang all the difficulties of M. Gobineau, and had
he been posted up to date here, his doubts would all
have vanished. The last twelve months have added
some very important facts to those previously published,
and we shall, with as little detail as possible,
present the subject in its newest light.</p>

<p>It is contended that when two animals of distinct
species, or, in other words, of distinct origin, are bred
together, they produce a hybrid which is <em>infertile</em>, or
which at least becomes sterile in a few generations if
preserved free from admixture with the parent stocks.
It is assumed that unlimited prolificness is a certain test
of community of origin.</p>

<p>We, on the contrary, contend that there is no abrupt
line of demarcation; that no complete laws of hybridity
have yet been established; that there is a <em>regular
gradation</em> in the prolificness of the species, and that,
according to the best lights we now possess, there is a
continued series from perfect sterility to perfect prolificacy.
The degrees may be expressed in the following
language:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That in which hybrids never reproduce; in other
words, where the mixed progeny begins and ends with
the first cross.</p>

<p>2. That in which the hybrids are incapable of producing
<i>inter se</i>, but multiply by union with the parent
stock.</p>

<p>3. That in which animals of unquestionably distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="page491" id="page491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
species produce a progeny which are prolific <i>inter se</i>,
but have a tendency to run out.</p>

<p>4. That which takes place between closely proximate
species; among mankind, for example, and among those
domestic animals most essential to human wants and
happiness; here the prolificacy is unlimited.</p>

<p>It seems to be a law that in those genera where
several or many species exist, there is a certain gradation
which is shown in degrees of hybridity; some
having greater affinity than others. Experiments are
still wanting to make our knowledge perfect, but we
know enough to establish our points.</p>

<p>There are many points we have not space to dwell
on, as the relative influence of the male and female on
the offspring; the tendency of one species to predominate
over another; the tendency of types to
"crop out" after lying dormant for many generations;
the fact that in certain species some of the progeny
take after one parent and some after the other, while
in other cases the offspring presents a medium type, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus</i> (Horse) comprises six species, of
which three belong to Asia, and three to Africa. The
Asiatic species are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus Caballus</i> (Horse), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus
Hemionus</i> (Dzigguetai), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus Asinus</i> (Ass).
Those of Africa are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus Zebra</i> (Zebra), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus
Montanus</i> (Daw), and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equus Quaccha</i> (Quagga).
The horse and ass alone have been submitted to domestication
from time immemorial; the others have
remained wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page492" id="page492">[Pg 492]</a></span>It is well known that the horse and ass produce
together an unprolific mule, and as these two species
are the furthest removed from each other in their
physical structure, Dr. Morton long since suggested
that intermediate species bred together would show a
higher degree of prolificness, and this prediction has
been vindicated by experiments recently made in the
Garden of Plants at Paris, where the ass and dzigguetai
have been bred together for the last ten years.
"What is very remarkable, these hybrids differ considerably
from each other; some resemble much more
closely the dzigguetai, others the ass." In regard to
the product of the male dzigguetai and the jenny, Mr.
Geoffroy St. Hilaire says:<a name="FNanchor-203" id="FNanchor-203"></a><a href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Another fact, not less worthy of interest, is the fecundity, if
not of all the mules, at least the firstborn among them; with
regard to this, the fact is certain; he has produced several
times with Jennies, and once with the female dzigguetai, the
only one he has covered."<a name="FNanchor-204" id="FNanchor-204"></a><a href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At a meeting of the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Zoologique d'Acclimation</span>,"</p>

<blockquote><p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">M. Richard (du Cantal) "parle des essais de croisements de
l'h&eacute;mione avec l'anesse, et dit qu'ils ont donn&egrave; un mulet beaucoup
<em>plus ardent</em> que l'&acirc;ne. Il asserte que les produits de
l'h&eacute;mione avec l'&acirc;ne, sont f&eacute;conds, et que le m&eacute;tis, nomm&eacute;
Polka, &agrave; d&eacute;ja produit."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493">[Pg 493]</a></span>To what extent the prolificness of these two species
will go is yet to be determined, and there is an unexplored
field still open among the other species of this
genus; it is highly probable that a gradation may be
established from sterility, up to perfect prolificacy.</p>

<p>Not only do the female ass and the male onager
breed together, but a male offspring of this cross, with
a mare, produces an animal more docile than either
parent, and combining the best physical qualities,
such as strength, speed, &amp;c.; whence the ancients preferred
the onager to the ass, for the production of
mules.<a name="FNanchor-205" id="FNanchor-205"></a><a href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> Mr. Gliddon, who lived upwards of twenty
years in Egypt and other eastern countries, informs me
this opinion is still prevalent in Egypt, and is acted
upon more particularly in Arabia, Persia, &amp;c., where
the <em>gour</em>, or wild ass, still roams the desert. The zebra
has also been several times crossed with the horse.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canis</i> contains a great many species, as
domestic dogs, wolves, foxes, jackals, &amp;c., and much
discussion exists as to which are really species and
which mere varieties. In this genus experiments in
crossing have been carried a step further than in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equid&aelig;</i>, but there is much yet to be done. All the
species produce prolific offspring, but how far the
prolificness might extend in each instance is not known;
there is reason to believe that every grade would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
found except that of absolute sterility which is seen
in the offspring of the horse and ass.</p>

<p>The following facts are given by M. Flourens, and
are the result of his own observations at the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Jardin des
Plantes</cite>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The hybrids of the dog and wolf are sterile after the <em>third</em>
generation; those of the jackal and dog, are so after the <em>fourth</em>.</p>

<p>"Moreover, if one of these hybrids is bred with one of the
primitive species, they soon return, completely and totally, to
this species.</p>

<p>"My experiments on the crossing of species have given me
opportunities of making a great many observations of this
kind.</p>

<p>"The union of the dog and jackal produces a hybrid&mdash;a mixed
animal, an animal partaking almost equally of the two, but
in which, however, the type of the <em>jackal</em> predominates over
that of the <em>dog</em>.</p>

<p>"I have remarked, in fact, in my experiments, that all types
are not equally dominant and persistent. The type of the dog
is more persistent than that of the wolf&mdash;that of the jackal
more than that of the dog; that of the horse is less than that
of the ass, &amp;c. The hybrid of the dog and the wolf partakes
more of the dog than the wolf; the hybrid of the jackal and
dog, takes more after the jackal than dog; the hybrid of the
horse and the ass partakes less of the horse than the ass; it
has the ears, back, rump, voice of the ass; the horse neighs,
the ass brays, and the mule brays like the ass, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The hybrid of the dog and jackal, then, partakes more of
the jackal than dog&mdash;it has straight ears, hanging tail, does not
bark, and is wild&mdash;it is more jackal than dog.</p>

<p>"So much for the <strong class="smcap">first</strong> cross product of the dog with the
jackal. I continue to unite, from generation to generation, the
successive products with one of the two primitive stocks&mdash;with
that of the dog, for example. The hybrid of the <em>second generation</em>
does not yet bark, but has already the ears pendent at the
ends, and is less savage. The hybrid of the third generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
barks, has the ears pendent, the tail turned up, and is no longer
wild. The hybrid of the <em>fourth generation</em> is entirely a dog.</p>

<p>"Four generations, then, have sufficed to re-establish one of
the two primitive types&mdash;the type of the dog; and four generations
suffice, also, to bring back the other type."<a name="FNanchor-206" id="FNanchor-206"></a><a href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From the foregoing facts, M. Flourens deduces,
without assigning a reason, the following <i>non sequitur</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thus, then, either hybrids, born of the union of two distinct
species, unite and soon become sterile, or they unite with
one of the parent stocks, and soon return to this type&mdash;they in
no case give what may be called a new species, that is to say,
an intermediate durable species."<a name="FNanchor-207" id="FNanchor-207"></a><a href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The dog also produces hybrids with the fox and
hyena, but to what extent has not yet been determined.
The hybrid fox is certainly prolific for several generations.</p>

<p>There are also bovine, camelline, caprine, ovine,
feline, deer with the ram, and endless other hybrids,
running through the animal kingdom, but they are but
repetitions of the above facts, and experiments are
still far from being complete in establishing the <em>degrees</em>
which attach to each two species. We have abundant
proofs, however, of the three first degrees of hybridity.
1st. Where the hybrid is infertile. 2d. Where it produces
with the parent stock. 3d. Where it is prolific<span class="pagenum"><a name="page496" id="page496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
for one, two, three, or four generations, and then becomes
sterile. Up to this point there is no diversity
of opinion. Let us now inquire what evidence there is
of the existence of the 4th degree, in which hybrids
may form a new and permanent race.</p>

<p>To show how slow has been our progress in this
question, and what difficulties beset our path, we need
only state that the facts respecting the dog, wolf, and
jackal, quoted above from Flourens, have only been
published within the last twelve months. The identity
of the dog and wolf has heretofore been undetermined,
and the <em>degrees</em> of hybridity of the dog with the wolf
and jackal were before unknown. These experiments
do not extend beyond one species of wolf.</p>

<p>M. Flourens says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">"<em>Les esp&egrave;ces ne s'alt&egrave;rent point, ne changent point, ne passent
point de l'une &agrave; l'autre; les esp&egrave;ces sont</em> <strong class="smcap">fix&eacute;s</strong>."</p>

<p>"If species have a tendency to transformation, to pass one
into another, why has not time, which, in everything, effects all
that can happen, ended by disclosing, by betraying, by implying
this tendency.</p>

<p>"But time, they may tell me, is wanting. It is not wanting.
It is 2000 years since Aristotle wrote, and we recognize in our
day all the animals which he describes; and we recognize them
by the characters which he assigns.... Cuvier states that
the history of the elephant is more exact in Aristotle than in
Buffon. They bring us every day from Egypt, the remains of
animals which lived there two or three thousand years ago&mdash;the
ox, crocodiles, ibis, &amp;c. &amp;c., which are the same as those of the
present day. We have under our eyes <em>human mummies</em>&mdash;the
skeleton of that day is identical with that of the Egyptian of
our day."</p></blockquote>

<p>(M. Flourens might have added that the mummies<span class="pagenum"><a name="page497" id="page497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
of the white and black races show them to have been
as distinct then as now, and that the monumental drawings
represent the different races more than a thousand
years further back.)</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thus, then, through three thousand years, no species has
changed. An experiment which continues through three thousand
years, is not an experiment to be made&mdash;it is an experiment
<em>made</em>. Species do not change."<a name="FNanchor-208" id="FNanchor-208"></a><a href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Permanence of type</em>, then, is the only test which he
can adduce for the designation of species, and he here
comes back plainly to the position we have taken. Let
us now test the races of men by this rule. The white
Asiatic races, the Jew, the Arab, the Egyptian, the
negro, at least, are distinctly figured on the monuments
of Egypt and Assyria, as distinct as they are now,
and <em>time</em> and change of climate have not transformed
any one type into another. In whatever unexplored
regions of the earth the earliest voyagers have gone,
they have found races equally well marked. These
races are all prolific <i>inter se</i>, and there is every reason
to believe that we here find the fourth and last degree
of hybridity. Whether the prolificacy is <em>unlimited</em> between
all the races or species of men is still an unsettled
point, and experiments have not yet been fully and
fairly made to determine the question. The dog and
wolf become sterile at the <em>third</em>. The dog and jackal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
at the fourth generation, and who can tell whether the
law of hybridity might not show itself in man, after a
longer succession of generations. There are no observations
yet of this kind in the human family. It is a
common belief in our Southern States, that mulattoes
are less prolific, and attain a less longevity than the
parent stocks. I am convinced of the truth of this remark,
when applied to the mulatto from the strictly
white and black races, and I am equally convinced,
from long personal observation, that the <em>dark</em>-skinned
European races, as Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians,
Basques, &amp;c., mingle much more perfectly with the negroes
than do fair races, thus carrying out the law of
gradation in hybridity. If the mulattoes of New Orleans
and Mobile be compared with those of the
Atlantic States, the fact will become apparent.</p>

<p>The argument in favor of unlimited prolificacy between
species may be strongly corroborated by an appeal
to the history of our domestic animals, whose
history is involved in the same impenetrable mystery
as that of man. M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire very justly
remarks that we know nothing of the origin of our
domestic animals; because we find wild hogs, goats,
sheep, &amp;c., in certain parts of Europe, several thousand
years subsequent to the early migrations of man, this
does not prove that the domestic come from these wild
ones. The reverse may be the case.<a name="FNanchor-209" id="FNanchor-209"></a><a href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499">[Pg 499]</a></span>We have already made some general observations on
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus canis</i>, whose natural history is most closely
allied to that of man. Let us now inquire whether
the domestic dog is but one species, or whether under
this head have been included many proximate species
of unlimited prolificacy. If we try the question by
<em>permanency of type</em>, like the races of men, and all well-marked
species, the doubt must be yielded.</p>

<p>There are strong reasons given by Dr. Morton and
other naturalists, for supposing that our common dogs,
independent of mixtures of <em>their</em> various races, may
also have an infusion of the blood of foxes, wolves,
jackals, and even the hyena; thus forming, as we see
every day around us, <em>curs</em> of every possible grade; but
setting aside all this, we have abundant evidence to
show that each zoological province has its original dog,
and, perhaps, not unfrequently several.</p>

<p>In one chapter on hybridity in the "<cite>Types of Mankind</cite>,"
it is shown that our Indian dogs in America
present several well-marked types, unlike any in the
Old World, and which are indigenous to the soil. For
example, the Esquimaux dog, the Hare Indian dog,
the North American dog, and several others. We
have not space here to enter fully into the facts, but
they will be found at length in the work above mentioned.
These dogs, too, are clearly traced to wild
species of this continent.</p>

<p>In other parts of the world we find other species
equally well marked, but we shall content ourselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the facts drawn from the ancient monuments of Egypt.
It is no longer a matter of dispute that as far back, at
least, as the twelfth dynasty, about 2300 years before
Christ, we find the common small dog of Egypt, the
greyhound, the staghound, the turnspit, and several
other types which do not correspond with any dogs
that can now be identified.<a name="FNanchor-210" id="FNanchor-210"></a><a href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a> We find, also, the mastiff
admirably portrayed on the monuments of Babylon,
which dog was first brought from the East to Greece
by Alexander the Great, 300 years B. C. The museums
of natural history, also, everywhere abound in the
remains of <em>fossil</em> dogs, which long antedate all living
species.</p>

<p>The wolf, jackal, and hyena are also found distinctly
drawn on the early monuments of Egypt, and a greyhound,
exactly like the English greyhound, with semi-pendent
ears, is seen on a statue in the Vatican, at Rome.
It is clear, then, that the leading types of dogs of the
present day (and probably all) existed more than four
thousand years ago, and it is equally certain that the
type of a dog, when kept pure, will endure in opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
climates for ages. Our staghounds, greyhounds, mastiffs,
turnspits, pointers, terriers, &amp;c., are bred for centuries,
not only in Egypt and Europe without losing
their types, but in any climate which does not destroy
them. No one denies that climate influences these animals
greatly, but the greyhound, staghound, or bulldog
can never be transformed into each other.</p>

<p>The facts above stated cannot be questioned, and it
is admitted that these species are all prolific without
limit <i>inter se</i>.</p>

<p>The llama affords another strong argument in favor
of the fourth degree of hybridity. Cuvier admits but
two species&mdash;the llama (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camelus llacma</i>), of which he
regards the <em>alpaca</em> as a variety, and the vigogne
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camelus vicunna</i>). More recent naturalists regard
the alpaca as a distinct species, among whom is M.
Geoffroy St. Hilaire.<a name="FNanchor-211" id="FNanchor-211"></a><a href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a> At all events, it seems settled
that they <em>all</em> breed together without limit.</p>

<p>We have recently seen exhibited in Mobile a beautiful
hybrid of the alpaca and common sheep, and the
owner informed us that he had a flock at home, which
breed perfectly.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman confesses that he has not examined the
drawings given in the works of Lepsius, Champollion,
Rossellini, and other Egyptologists, of various animals
represented on the monuments, and ridicules the idea
of their being received as authority in matters of natural
history. Although many of the drawings are rudely
done, most of them, in outline, are beautifully executed,
and Dr. B. is the first, so far as we know, to call the
fact in question. Dr. Chas. Pickering is received by
Dr. B. as high authority in scientific matters&mdash;he has
not only examined these drawings, but their originals.
Lepsius, Champollion, Rossellini, Wilkinson, and all
the Egyptologists, have borne witness to the reliability
of these drawings, and have enumerated hundreds of
animals and plants which are perfectly identified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503">[Pg 503]</a></span>Martin, the author of the work on "<cite>Man and
Monkeys</cite>," is certainly good authority. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Now we have in modern Egypt and Arabia, and also in
Persia, varieties of greyhound closely resembling those of the
ancient remains of art, and it would appear that two or three
varieties exist&mdash;one smooth, another long haired, and another
smooth with long-haired ears, resembling those of the spaniel.
In Persia, the greyhound, to judge from specimens we have seen,
is silk-haired, with a fringed tail. They are of a black color;
but a fine breed, we are informed, is of a slate or ash color, as
are some of the smooth-haired greyhounds depicted in the
Egyptian paintings. In Arabia, a large, rough, powerful race
exists; and about Akaba, according to Laborde, a breed of
slender form, fleet, with a long tail, very hairy, in the form of a
brush, with the ears erect and pointed, closely resembling, in
fact, many of those figured by the ancient Egyptians."<a name="FNanchor-213" id="FNanchor-213"></a><a href="#Footnote-213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to quote Col. Sykes, and others, for other
varieties of greyhound in the east, unlike any in Europe.</p>

<p>Dr. Pickering, after enumerating various objects
identified on the monuments of the third and fourth
dynasties, as Nubians, white races, the ostrich, ibis,
jackal, antelope, hedgehog, goose, fowls, ducks, bullock,
donkey, goats, dog-faced ape, hyena, porcupine, wolves,
foxes, &amp;c. &amp;c., when he comes down to the twelfth
dynasty, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The paintings on the walls represent a vast variety of subjects;
including, most unexpectedly, the greater part of the <em>arts</em>
and <em>trades</em> practised among civilized nations at the present day;
also birds, quadrupeds, fishes, and insects, amounting to an <em>extended
treatise on zoology</em>, well deserving the attention of naturalists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504">[Pg 504]</a></span>The date accompanying these representations has been
astronomically determined by Biot, at about B. C. 2200

computation corresponds."<a name="FNanchor-214" id="FNanchor-214"></a><a href="#Footnote-214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. P. gives us a fauna and flora of Egypt, running
further back than Usher's date for the creation, and it
cannot be doubted that the drawings are as reliable as
those in any modern work on natural history.</p>

<p>Mr. Gobineau remarks (<a title="Go to page 367." href="#page367">p. 367</a>), that he has very
serious doubts as to the unity of origin. "These
doubts, however," he continues, "I am compelled to
repress, because they are in contradiction to a scientific
fact, which I cannot refute&mdash;the prolificness of half-breeds;
and secondly, what is of much greater weight
with me, they impugn a religious interpretation sanctioned
by the church."</p>

<p>With regard to the prolificness of half-breeds, I have
already mentioned such facts as might have served to
dispel the learned writer's doubts, had he been acquainted
with them. In reference to the other, more
serious, obstacle to his admission of the plurality of
origins, he himself intimates (<a title="Go to page 339." href="#page339">p. 339</a>) that the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
of this interpretation might, perhaps, be questioned
without transgressing the limits imposed by the church.
Believing this view to be correct, I shall venture on a
few remarks upon this last scruple of the author, which
is shared by many investigators of this interesting subject.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The strict rule of scientific scrutiny," says the most learned
and formidable opponent in the adversary's camp,<a name="FNanchor-215" id="FNanchor-215"></a><a href="#Footnote-215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a> "exacts,
according to modern philosophers, in matters of inductive
reasoning, an exclusive homage. It requires that we should
close our eyes against all presumptive and exterior evidence,
and <em>abstract our minds from all considerations not derived from
the matters of fact which bear immediately on the question</em>. The
maxim we have to follow in such controversies is '<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fiat justitia,
ruat c&oelig;lum.</span>' <em>In fact, what is actually true, it is always desirous
to know, whatever consequences may arise from its admission.</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p>To this sentiment I cheerfully subscribe: it has always
been my maxim. Yet I find it necessary, in
treating of this subject, to touch on its <em>biblical</em> connections,
for although we have great reason to rejoice at
the improved tone of toleration, or even liberality
which prevails in this country, the day has not
come when science can be severed from theology, and
the student of nature can calmly follow her truths, no
matter whither they may lead. What a mortifying
picture do we behold in the histories of astronomy,
geology, chronology, cosmogony, geographical distribution
of animals, &amp;c.; they have been compelled to
fight their way, step by step, through human passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
and prejudice, from their supposed contradiction to
Holy Writ. But science has been vindicated&mdash;their
great truths have been established, and the Bible stands
as firmly as it did before. The last great struggle between
science and theology is the one we are now engaged
in&mdash;the <em>natural history of man</em>&mdash;it has now, for
the first time, a fair hearing before Christendom, and
all any question should ask is "<em>daylight and fair
play</em>."</p>

<p>The Bible should not be regarded as a text-book of
natural history. On the contrary, it must be admitted
that none of the writers of the Old or New Testament
give the slightest evidence of knowledge in any
department of science beyond that of their profane
contemporaries; and we hold that the natural history
of man is a department of science which should be
placed upon the same footing with others, and its facts
dispassionately investigated. What we require for our
guidance in this world is truth, and the history of
science shows how long it has been stifled by bigotry
and error.</p>

<p>It was taught for ages that the sun moved around
the earth; that there had been but one creation of
organized beings; that our earth was created but six
thousand years ago, and that the stars were made to
shed light upon it; that the earth was a plane, with
sides and ends; that all the animals on earth were derived
from Noah's ark, &amp;c. But what a different revelation
does science give us? We now know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
earth revolves around the sun, that the earth is a globe
which turns on its own axis, that there has been a succession
of destructions and creations of living beings,
that the earth has existed countless ages, and that
there are stars so distant as to require millions of years
for their light to reach us; that instead of one, there
are many centres of creation for existing animals and
plants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If so many false readings of the Bible have been
admitted among theologians, who has authority or
wisdom to say to science&mdash;"thus far shalt thou go,
and no further?" The doctrine of <em>unity</em> for the human
family may be another great error, and certainly a
denial of its truth does no more, nay, less violence to the
language of the Bible, than do the examples above cited.</p>

<p>It is a popular error, and one difficult to eradicate,
that all the species of animals now dwelling on the
earth are descendants of pairs and septuples preserved
in Noah's ark, and certainly the language of Genesis
on this point is too plain to admit of any quibble; it
does teach that every living being perished by the
flood, except those alone which were saved in the ark.
Yet no living naturalist, in or out of the church, believes
this statement to be correct. The centres of
creation are so numerous, and the number of animals
so great that it is impossible it should be so.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the first chapter of Genesis gives
an account entirely in accordance with the teachings
of science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"And God said, let the earth bring forth <em>grass</em>, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind,
whose seed is in itself upon the earth; and it was so." <cite>Gen.</cite>
i. 11.</p>

<p>"And God said, let the waters bring forth <em>abundantly</em>, the
moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the
earth in the open firmament of heaven." v. 20.</p>

<p>"And God created great <em>whales</em>, and every living creature
that moveth, which the waters brought forth <em>abundantly</em>," &amp;c.
v. 21.</p>

<p>"And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast of the earth
after his kind, and it was so." v. 24.</p>

<p>"God created <em>man</em> in his own image; <em>male</em> and <em>female</em> created
he <em>them</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the language above quoted, nothing is said about
one seed or one blade of grass; about one fruit tree,
or about <em>single pairs</em> of animals or human beings. On
the contrary, this chapter closes with the distinct impression
on the mind that everything was created
<em>abundantly</em>. The only difficulty arises with regard to
the human family, and we are here confused by the
contradictory statements of the first and second chapters.
In the first chapter, man was created <em>male and
female</em>, on the sixth day&mdash;in the second chapter, woman
was not created until after Adam was placed in the
Garden of Eden. Commentators explain this discrepancy
by the difference in style of the two chapters, and
the inference that Genesis is a compilation made up by
Moses from two or three different writers; but it is
not our purpose here to open these theological discussions.
Both sides are sustained by innumerable authorities.
From what we have before shown, it is clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
that the inspired writers possessed no knowledge of
physical sciences, and as little respecting the natural
history of man, as of any other department.</p>

<p>Their <em>moral</em> mission does not concern our subject,
and we leave that to theologians, to whom it more
properly belongs. On the other hand, we ask to be
let alone in our study of the physical laws of the universe.
The theologian and the naturalist have each
an ample field without the necessity of interfering with
each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is here viewed only in its relations with
physical science. We have already alluded to the fact
that in astronomy, geology, &amp;c., the authors of the
Bible possessed no knowledge beyond that of their
profane contemporaries, and a dispassionate examination
of the text from Genesis to Revelation will show
that the writers had but an imperfect knowledge of
contemporary races, and did not design to teach the
doctrine of unity of mankind, or rather origin from a
single pair. The writer of the <cite>Pentateuch</cite> could
attach little importance to such an idea, as he nowhere
alludes to a future existence, or rewards and
punishments&mdash;all good and evil, as far as the human
race is concerned, with him, were merely temporal.</p>

<p>This idea of a future state does not distinctly appear
in the Jewish writings until after their return from the
Babylonish captivity.</p>

<p>The extent of the surface of the globe, known even
to the writers of the New Testament, formed but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
small fraction of it&mdash;little beyond the confines of the
Roman empire. No allusion is even made to Southern
and Eastern Asia; Africa, south of the Desert; Australia,
America, &amp;c.; all of which were inhabited long
before the time of Moses; and of the races of men inhabiting
these countries, and their languages, they
certainly knew nothing. The Chinese and Indian
empires, at least, are beyond dispute. The early
Hebrews were a pastoral people; had little commercial
or other intercourse with the rest of the world,
and were far from being "learned in all the wisdom
of the Egyptians." The Egyptian empire was fully
developed&mdash;arts and science as flourishing&mdash;pyramids
and gorgeous temples built, not only before the time
of Moses, but long prior to that of the Patriarch
Abraham, who, with Sarah, went to Egypt to buy
corn of the reigning Pharaoh. What is remarkable,
too, the Egyptians had their ethnographers, and had
already classified the human family into four races, and
depicted them on the monuments, viz: the black,
white, yellow, and red.<a name="FNanchor-216" id="FNanchor-216"></a><a href="#Footnote-216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a></p>

<p>In fact, nothing can be more incomplete, contradictory,
and unsatisfactory than the ethnography of Genesis.
We see Cain going into a foreign land and taking
a wife before there were any women born of his parent
stock. Cities are seen springing up in the second and
third generations, in every direction, &amp;c. All this
shows that we have in Genesis no satisfactory history<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
of the human family, and that we can rely no more
upon its ethnography than upon its geography, astronomy,
cosmogony, geology, zoology, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to the fact that the writers
of the New Testament give no evidence of additional
knowledge in such matters. The sermon from the
Mount comes like a light from Heaven, but this volume
is mute on all that pertains to the physical laws of the
universe.</p>

<p>If the common origin of man were such an important
point in the eyes of the Almighty as we have been
taught to believe, is it reasonable to suppose it would
have been left by the inspired writers in such utter
confusion and doubt? The coming of Christ changed
the whole question, and we should expect, at least in
the four Gospels, for some authority that would settle
this vital point; but strange as the assertion may seem,
there is not a single passage here to be found, which,
by any distortion, can be made to sustain this <em>unity</em>;
and on searching diligently the New Testament, from
one end to the other, we were not a little surprised to
find but a single text that seemed to bear directly upon
it, viz: the oft quoted one in Acts xvii. 26: "And
hath made of <em>one blood</em> all nations of men for to dwell
on all the face of the earth," &amp;c. Being astonished at
the fact that this great question of common origin of
man should thus be made to hang so much upon a
single verse, it occurred to me that there might be
some error, some interpolation in the text, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
no material at hand for such an investigation in Mobile,
I wrote to a competent friend in Philadelphia, to examine
for me all the Greek texts and old versions, and
his reply confirmed fully my suspicions. The word
<em>blood</em> is an interpolation, and not to be found in the
original texts. The word <em>blood</em> has been rejected by
the Catholic Church, from the time of St. Jerome to
the present hour. The text of Tischendorf is regarded,
I believe, generally as the most accurate Greek text
known, and in this the word blood does not appear. I
have at hand a long list of authorities to the same
effect, but as it is presumed no competent authority
will call our assertion in question, it is needless to cite
them. The verse above alluded to in Acts should,
therefore, read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"And hath made of <em>one</em> all races (genus) of men," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The word <em>blood</em> is a gloss, and we have just as much
right to interpolate <em>one form</em>, <em>one substance</em>, <em>one nature</em>,
<em>one responsibility</em>, or anything else, as <em>blood</em>.</p>

<p>These remarks on the ethnography of the Bible
might be greatly extended, but my object here is simply
to show that the Bible, to say the least, leaves the field
open, and that I have entered it soberly, discreetly,
and advisedly.</p>

"His theory," says Van Amringe, "required that animals should
be analogous to man. It was therefore highly important that,
as he was then laying the foundation for all his future arguments
and conclusions, he should elevate animals to the proper eminence,
to be analogous; rather than, as Mr. Lawrence did, sink
man to the level of brutes. It was an ingenious contrivance by
which he could gain all the advantages, and escape the censures
of the learned lecturer. It is so simple a contrivance, too&mdash;merely
substituting the word 'psychological' for 'instinctive
characteristics,' and the whole animal kingdom would instantly
rise to the proper platform, to be the types of the human family.
To get the psychology of men and animals thus related, without
the trouble of philosophically accomplishing so impossible a
thing, by the mere use of a word, was an ingenious, though not
an ingenuous achievement. It gave him a specious right to use
bees and wasps, rats and dogs, sheep, goats, and rabbits&mdash;in
short, the whole animal kingdom&mdash;as human psychical analogues,
which would be amazingly convenient when conclusions were to
be made."&mdash;<cite>Natural History of Man</cite>, by <cite class="author">W. F. Van Amringe</cite>.

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-13" id="Footnote-13"></a> Unwilling to introduce statistic pedantry into a composition
of so humble pretensions as an introduction, I have refrained to
give the figures&mdash;not always very accurate, I admit&mdash;upon which
the preceding gradation is based, viz: the number of persons
able to read and write in each of the above-named countries.
How far England and France are behindhand in this respect,
compared either with ourselves, or with other European nations,
is tolerably well known; but the fact that not only in China
proper, but in Thibet, Japan, Anam, Tonquin, etc., few can be
found devoid of that acquirement, will probably meet with many
incredulous readers, though it is mentioned by almost every
traveller. (See <cite>J. Mohl's Annual Report to the Asiatic Society</cite>, 1851.)
But, it may be safely asserted that, in the whole of that portion
of Asia lying south of the Altai Mountains, including Japan,
altogether the most populous region of the globe, the percentage
of males unable to read and write is by far smaller than in the
entire population of Europe. Be it well understood, that I do
not, therefore, claim any superiority for the inhabitants of the
former region over those of the latter.

"In China," says M. Huc, "there are not, as in Europe,
public libraries and reading-rooms; but those who have a taste
for reading, and a desire to instruct themselves, can satisfy their
inclinations very easily, as books are sold here at a lower price
than in any other country. Besides, the Chinese find everywhere
something to read; they can scarcely take a step without seeing
some of the characters of which they are so proud. One may
say, in fact, that all China is an immense library; for inscriptions,
sentences, moral precepts, are found in every corner, written in
letters of all colors and all sizes. The fa&ccedil;ades of the tribunals,
the pagodas, the public monuments, the signs of the shops, the
doors of the houses, the interior of the apartments, the corridors,
all are full of fine quotations from the best authors. Teacups,
plates, vases, fans, are so many selections of poems, often chosen
with much taste, and prettily printed. A Chinese has no need
to give himself much trouble in order to enjoy the finest productions
of his country's literature. He need only take his pipe,
and walk out, with his nose in the air, through the principal
streets of the first town he comes to. Let him enter the poorest
house in the most wretched village; the destitution may be complete,
things the most necessary will be wanting; but he is sure
of finding some fine maxims written out on strips of red paper.
Thus, if those grand large characters, which look so terrific in
our eyes, though they delight the Chinese, are really so difficult
to learn, at least the people have the most ample opportunities
of studying them, almost in play, and of impressing them ineffaceably
on their memories."&mdash;<cite>A Journey through the Chinese

were French, and that to the same nation belong

or that, notwithstanding its political extravaganzas, every liberal

or has not, such facts are familiar. It is well known, for instance,
that in some of the most polished European countries,
the wooden ploughshare is still used; and that, in Paris, that
metropolis of arts and fashion, every drop of water must be
carried, in buckets, from the public fountains to the Dutchess'
<em>boudoir</em> in the first, and to the Grisette's garret in the seventh
story. Compare this with the United States, where&mdash;not to

her water-works, if required by her topography. Are we, then,

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-16" id="Footnote-16"></a> Since writing the above, I lit upon the following striking
confirmation of my idea by Dr. Pickering, whose analogism here
so closely resembles mine, as almost to make me suspect myself
of unconscious plagiarism. "While admitting the general truth,
that mankind are essentially alike, no one doubts the existence
of character, distinguishing not only individuals, but communities
and nations. I am persuaded that there is, besides, a
character of race. It would not be difficult to select epithets;
such as 'amphibious, enduring, insititious;' or to point out
as accomplished by one race of men, that which seemed beyond
the powers of another. Each race possessing its peculiar points
of excellence, and, at the same time, counterbalancing defects,
it may be that union was required to attain the full measure of
civilization. In the organic world, each field requires a new
creation; each change in circumstances going beyond the constitution
of a plant or animal, is met by a new adaptation, until
the whole universe is full; while, among the immense variety of
created beings, two kinds are hardly found fulfilling the same
precise purpose. Some analogy may possibly exist in the human
family; and it may even be questioned, whether any one of the
races existing singly would, up to the present day, have extended
itself over the whole surface of the globe."&mdash;<cite>The Races of Man,

II., the Sesostris of the Greeks, and even of monarchs as far back
as the IVth dynasty. To understand that this is no vain boast,
the reader must remember that these hieroglyphics mostly contain
records of private or royal lives, and that the mural paintings

scenes illustrative of trades, or other occupations, games, etc.,

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-20" id="Footnote-20"></a> The term "race" is of relative meaning, and, though often
erroneously used synonymously with <em>species</em>, by no means signifies
the same. The most strenuous advocates of sameness of
species, use it to designate well-defined groups, as the white and
black. If we consider ourselves warranted by the language of
the Bible, to believe in separate origins of the human family,
then, indeed, it may be considered as similar in meaning to
species; otherwise, it must signify but subdivisions of one. We
may therefore speak of ten or a hundred races of man, without
impugning their being descended from the same stock. All that
is here contended for is, that the distinctive features of such
races, in whatever manner they may have originated, are now
persistent. Two men may, the one arrive at the highest honors
of the State, the other, with every facility at his command,
forever remain in mediocrity. Yet, these two men may be
brothers.
</p><p>
That the question of species, when disconnected from any
theological bearing, is one belonging exclusively to the province
of the naturalist, and in which the metaphysician can have but
a subordinate part, may be illustrated by a homely simile. Diversity
of talent in the same family involves no doubt of parentage;
but, if one child be born with a black skin and woolly hair,
questions about the paternity might indeed arise.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-27" id="Footnote-27"></a> Among many passages illustrative of the ultra utilitarianism
of the Chinese, I can find space but for one, and that
selected almost at random. After speaking of the exemplary
diffusion of primary instruction among the masses, he says
that, though they all read, and frequently, yet even their reading
is of a strictly utilitarian character, and never answers any
but practical purposes or temporary amusement. The name
of the author is seldom known, and never inquired after.
"That class are, in their eyes, only idle persons, who pass
their time in making prose or verse. They have no objection
to such a pursuit. A man may, they say, 'amuse himself with
his pen as with his kite, if he likes it as well&mdash;it is all a matter
of taste.' The inhabitants of the celestial empire would never
recover from their astonishment if they knew to what extent
intellectual labor may be in Europe a source of honor and often
wealth. If they were told that a person among us may obtain
great glory by composing a drama or a novel, they would either
not believe it, or set it down as an additional proof of our well-known
want of common sense. How would it be if they should
be told of the renown of a dancer or a violin player, and that
one cannot make a bound, nor the other draw a bow anywhere
without thousands of newspapers hastening to spread the important
news over all the kingdoms of Europe!
</p><p>
"The Chinese are too decided utilitarians to enter into our
views of the arts. In their opinion, a man is only worthy of the
admiration of his fellow-creatures when he has well fulfilled
the social duties, and especially if he knows better than any
one else how to get out of a scrape. You are regarded as a
man of genius if you know how to regulate your family, make
your lands fruitful, traffic with ability, and realize great profits.
This, at least, is the only kind of genius that is of any value
in the eyes of these eminently practical men."&mdash;<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voyages en

"1608, Dec. 1.&mdash;The Earl of Mar declared to the council, that
some women were taken in Broughton as witches, and being put
to an assize, and convicted, albeit they persevered constant in
their denial to the end, they were burnt quick (alive), after such
a cruel manner, that some of them died in despair, renouncing
and blaspheming God; and <em>others, half-burned, brak out of the
fire, and were cast in it again, till they were burned to death</em>." Entry
in Sir Thomas Hamilton's <cite>Minutes of Proceedings in the Privy
Council</cite>. (From W. Scott's <cite>Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft</cite>,
p. 315.)
</p><p>
Really, I do not believe that the Peruvians ever carried fanaticism
so far. Yet, a counterpart to this horrible picture is found
in the history of New England. A man, named Cory, being
accused of witchcraft, and refusing to plead, was accordingly
pressed to death. And when, in the agony of death, the unfortunate
man thrust out his tongue, the sheriff, without the least
emotion, crammed it back into the mouth with his cane. (See
Cotton Mather's <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magnalia Christi Americana</cite>, Hardford. <cite>Thau.
Pneu</cite>, c. vii. p. 383, <i>et passim</i>.)
</p><p>
Did the ferocity of the most brutish savages ever invent any
torture more excruciating than that in use in the British Isles,
not much more than two centuries ago, for bringing poor, decrepit
old women to the confession of a crime which never existed
but in the crazed brain of bigots. "The nails were torn from the
fingers with smith's pincers; pins driven into the places which the
nails defended; the knees were crushed in the <em>boots</em>, the finger-bones
splintered in the <em>pilniewinks</em>," etc. (Scott, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 312.)
But then, it is true, they had a more <em>gentle</em> torture, which an English
Lord (Eglington) had the honor and humanity to invent! This
consisted in placing the legs of a poor woman in the stocks, and
then <em>loading the bare shins with bars of iron</em>. Above thirty stones
of iron were placed upon the limbs of an unfortunate woman
before she could be brought to the confession which led her to
the stake. (Scott, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, pp. 321, 324, 327, etc. etc.)
</p><p>
As late as 1682, not yet 200 years ago, three women were
hanged, in England, for witchcraft; and the fatal statute against
it was not abolished until 1751, when the rabble put to death, in
the most horrible manner, an old pauper woman, and very nearly
killed another.
</p><p>
And, in the middle of last century, eighty-five persons were
burnt, or otherwise executed, for witchcraft, at Mohra, in
Sweden. Among them were fifteen young children.
</p><p>
If God had ordained that fanaticism should be punished by
national ruin, were not these crimes, in which, in most cases,
the whole nation participated, were not they horrible enough to
draw upon the perpetrators the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah?
Surely, if fanaticism were the cause of national decay, most
European nations had long since been swept from the face of
the globe, "so that their places could nowhere be found."&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-36" id="Footnote-36"></a> There seem, at first sight, to be exceptions to the truth of
the assertion, that luxury, in itself, is not productive of national
ruin. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, etc., were <em>aristocratic</em> republics, in
which, as in monarchies, a high degree of luxury is not only
compatible with, but may even be greatly conducive to the
prosperity of the state. But the basis of a <em>democratic</em> republic
is a more or less perfect equality among its citizens, which is
often impaired, and, in the end, subverted by too great a disparity
of wealth. Yet, even in them, glaring contrasts between
extravagant luxury and abject poverty are rather the sign than
the cause, of the disappearance of democratic principles. Examples
might be adduced from history, of democracies in which
great wealth did not destroy democratic ideas and a consequent
simplicity of manners. These ideas must first be forgotten,
before wealth can produce luxury, and luxury its attendant
train of evils. Though accelerating the downfall of a democratic
republic, it is therefore not the primary cause of that
downfall.&mdash;H.</p>

one who reflects on the principles upon which this legislation
was based. Inculcating that war was the great business of
life, and to be terrible to one's enemies the only object of manly
ambition, the Spartan laws sacrificed the noblest private virtues
and domestic affections. They deprived the female character
of the charms that most adorn it&mdash;modesty, tenderness,
and sensibility; they made men brutal, coarse, and cruel.
They stunted individual talents; Sparta has produced but few
great men, and these, says Macaulay, only became great when
they ceased to be Lacedemonians. Much unsound sentimentality
has been expended in eulogizing Sparta, from Xenophon
down to Mitford, yet the verdict of the unbiassed historian cannot
differ very widely from that of Macaulay: "The Spartans
purchased for their government a prolongation of its existence
by the sacrifice of happiness at home, and dignity abroad.
They cringed to the powerful, they trampled on the weak, they
massacred their helots, they betrayed their allies, they contrived
to be a day too late for the battle of Marathon, they
attempted to avoid the battle of Salamis, they suffered the
Athenians, to whom they owed their lives and liberties, to be a
second time driven from their country by the Persians, that
they might finish their own fortifications on the Isthmus; they
attempted to take advantage of the distress to which exertions
in their cause had reduced their preservers, in order to make
them their slaves; they strove to prevent those who had abandoned
their walls to defend them, from rebuilding them to defend
themselves; they commenced the Peloponnesian war in
violation of their engagements with their allies; they gave up
to the sword whole cities which had placed themselves under
their protection; they bartered for advantages confined to
themselves the interests, the freedom, and the lives of those
who had served them most faithfully; they took, with equal
complacency, and equal infamy, the stripes of Elis and the
bribes of Persia; they never showed either resentment or gratitude;
they abstained from no injury, and they revenged none.
Above all, they looked on a citizen who served them well as
their deadliest enemy."&mdash;<cite>Essays</cite>, iii. 389.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-39" id="Footnote-39"></a> The horrid scenes of California life, its lynch laws, murders,
and list of all possible crimes, are still ringing in our ears, and
have not entirely ceased, though their number is lessened, and they
are rapidly disappearing before lawful order. Australia offered,
and still offers, the same spectacle. Texas, but a few years ago,
and all newly settled countries in our day, afford another striking
illustration of the author's remark. Young communities ever
attract a great number of lawless and desperate men; and this
has been the case in all ages. Rome was founded by a band of
fugitives from justice, and if her early history be critically examined,
it will be found to reveal a state of society, with which
the Rome described by the Satirists, and upbraided by the Censors,
compares favorably. Any one who will cast a glance into
Bishop Potter's <cite>Antiquities</cite>, can convince himself that the state
of morals, in Athens, was no better in her most flourishing periods
than at the time of her downfall, if, indeed, as good; notwithstanding
the glowing colors in which Isocrates and his followers
describe the virtues of her youthful period, and the
degeneracy of the age. Who can doubt that public morality
has attained a higher standard in England, at the present day
when her strength seems to have departed from her, than it had
at any previous era in her history. Where are the brutal fox-hunting
country squires of former centuries? the good old customs,
when hospitality consisted in drinking one's guest underneath
the table? What audience could now endure, or what
police permit, the plays of Congreve and of Otway? Even Shakspeare
has to be pruned by the moral censor, before he can charm
our ears. Addison himself, than whom none contributed more
to purify the morals of his age, bears unmistakable traces of
the coarseness of the time in which he wrote. It will be objected
that we are only more prudish, no better at the bottom. But,
even supposing that the same vices still exist, is it not a great
step in advance, that they dare no longer parade themselves with
unblushing impudence? Many who derive their ideas of the
Middle Ages, of chivalry, etc., from the accounts of romance
writers, have very erroneous notions about the manners of that
period. "It so happens," says Byron, "that the good old times
when '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'amour du bon vieux temps, l'amour antique</i>' flourished,
were the most profligate of all possible centuries. Those who
have any doubts on the subject may consult St. Palay, particularly
vol. ii. p. 69. The vows of chivalry were no better kept
than any other vows whatever, and the songs of the troubadour
were not more decent, and certainly much less refined, than those
of Ovid. The 'cours d'amour, parlements d'amour, ou de courtoisie
et de gentilesse,' had much more of love than of courtesy
and gentleness. (See Roland on the same subject with St. Palay.)"
<cite>Preface to Childe Harold.</cite> I should not have quoted the authority
of a poet on historical matters, were I not convinced, from
my own investigations, that his pungent remarks are perfectly
correct. As a further confirmation, I may mention that a few
years ago, in rummaging over the volumes of a large European
library, I casually lit upon a record of judicial proceedings
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in a little commonwealth,
whose simplicity of manners, and purity of public morals,
especially in that period, has been greatly extolled by historians.
There, I found a list of crimes, to which the most corrupt of
modern great cities can furnish no parallel. In horror and hellish
ingenuity, they can be faintly approached only by the punishment
which followed them. Of many, our generation ignores
even the name, and, of others, dares not utter them.&mdash;H.</p>

fascinating ladies somewhat over-kind; of succulent dinners,
somewhat indigestible; of pleasures, somewhat illicit;&mdash;the other,

"The history of Gregory of Tours shows us on the one hand,
a fierce and barbarous nation; and on the other, kings of as
bad a character. These princes were bloody, unjust, and cruel,
because all the nation was so. If Christianity seemed sometimes
to soften them, it was only by the terror which this religion imprints
in the guilty; the church supported herself against them
by the miracles and prodigies of her saints. The kings were not
sacrilegious, because they dreaded the punishments inflicted on
sacrilegious people: but this excepted, they committed, either
in their passion or cold blood, all manner of crimes and injustice,
because in these the avenging hand of the Deity did not
appear so visible. The Franks, as I have already observed,
bore with bloody kings, because they were fond of blood themselves;
they were not affected with the wickedness and extortion
of their princes, because this was their own character. There
had been a great many laws established, but the kings rendered
them all useless by the practice of issuing <em>preceptions</em>, a kind of
decrees, after the manner of the rescripts of the Roman emperors.
These preceptions were orders to the judges to do, or to
tolerate, things contrary to law. They were given for illicit
marriages, and even those with consecrated virgins; for transferring
successions, and depriving relations of their rights; for
putting to death persons who had not been convicted of any
crime, and not been heard in their defence, etc."&mdash;<cite class="author">Montesquieu</cite>,

the habit of looking upon Spain as the type of hopeless national
degradation. But whoever studies the history of the last thirty
years, which is but a series of struggles to rise from this position,
will probably arrive at the same conclusions as the author.
The revolution of 1820 redeems the character of the nation.
"The Spanish Constitution" became the watchword of the
friends of constitutional liberty in the South of Europe, and ere
thirteen months had fully passed, it had become the fundamental
law of three other countries&mdash;Portugal, Naples, and Sardinia.
At the mere sound of those words, two kings had resigned their
crowns. These revolutions were not characterized by excesses.
They were, for the most part, accomplished peacefully, quietly,
and orderly. They were not the result of the temporary passions
of an excited mob. The most singular feature of these
countries is that the lowest dregs of the population are the most
zealous adherents of absolutism. No, these revolutions were
the work of the best elements in the population, the most intelligent
classes, of people who knew what they wanted, and how
to get it. And then, when Spain had set that ever glorious example to her neighbors, the great powers, with England at the
head, concluded to re-establish the former state of things. In
those memorable congresses of plenipotentiaries, the most influential
was the representative of England, the Duke of Wellington.
And by his advice, or, at least, with his sanction, an
Austrian army entered Sardinia, and abolished the new constitution;
an Austrian army entered Naples and abolished the new
constitution; English vessels of war threatened Lisbon, and Portugal
abolished her new constitution; and finally a French army
entered Spain, and abolished the new constitution. So Naples
and Portugal regained their tyrants, and Spain her imbecile
dynasty. For years the Spaniards have tried to shake it off,
and English influence alone has maintained on a great nation's
throne, a wretch that would have disgraced the lowest walks of
private life. But the day of Spanish liberty and Spanish <em>independence</em>
will dawn, and perhaps already has dawned. The efforts
of the last Cortes were wisely directed, and their proceedings
marked with a manliness, a moderation, and a firmness that
augur well for the future weal of Spain.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-51" id="Footnote-51"></a> It is obvious that so long as the vitality of a nation remains
unimpaired, misgovernment can be but a temporary ill. The
regenerative principle will be at work to remove the evil and
heal the wounds it has inflicted; and though the remedy be
sometimes violent, and throw the state into fearful convulsions,
it will seldom be found ineffectual. So long as the spirit of
liberty prevailed among the Romans, the Tarquiniuses and
Appiuses were as a straw before the storm of popular indignation;
but the death of C&aelig;sar could but substitute a despot in
the stead of a mild and generous usurper. The first Brutus
might save the nation, because he was the expression of the
national sentiment; the second could not, because he was one
man opposed to millions. It is a common error to ascribe too
much to individual exertions, and whimsical philosophers have
amused themselves to trace great events to petty causes; but
a deeper inquiry will demonstrate that the great catastrophes
which arrest our attention and form the landmarks of history,
are but the inevitable result of all the whole chain of antecedent
events. Julius C&aelig;sar and Napoleon Bonaparte were, indeed,
especially gifted for their great destinies, but the same gifts
could not have raised them to their exalted positions at any
other epoch than the one in which each lived. Those petty
causes are but the drop which causes the measure to overflow,
the pretext of the moment; or as the small fissure in the dyke
which produces the <em>crevasse</em>: the wall of waters stood behind.
No man can usurp supreme power, unless the prevailing tendency
of the nation favors it; no man can long persist in hurrying
a nation along in a course repulsive to it; and in this
sense, therefore, not with regard to its abstract justness, it is
undoubtedly true, that the voice of the nation is the voice of
God. It is the expression of what shall and must be.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-52" id="Footnote-52"></a> The author has neglected to advert to one very clear explanation
of this word, which, from its extensive popularity,
seems to me to deserve some notice. It is said, and very commonly
believed, that there is a physical degeneracy in mankind;
that a nation cultivating for a long time the arts of peace, and
enjoying the fruits of well-directed industry, loses the capacity
for warfare; in other words becomes effeminate, and, consequently,
less capable of defending itself against ruder, and, therefore,
more warlike invaders. It is further said, though with less
plausibility, that there is a general degeneracy of the human
race&mdash;that we are inferior in physical strength to our ancestors,
etc. If this theory could be supported by incontestable facts&mdash;and
there are many who think it possible&mdash;it would give to the
term degeneracy that real and tangible meaning which the author
alleges to be wanting. But a slight investigation will demonstrate
that it is more specious than correct.
</p><p>
In the first place, to prove that an advance in civilization
does not lessen the material puissance of a nation, but rather
increases it, we may point to the well-known fact that the most
civilized nations are the most formidable opponents in warfare,
because they have brought the means of attack and defence to
the greatest perfection.
</p><p>
But that for this strength they are not solely indebted to artificial
means, is proved by the history of modern civilized states.
The French now fight with as much martial ardor and intrepidity,
and with more success than they did in the times of Francis
I. or Louis XIV., albeit they have since both these epochs
made considerable progress in civilization, and this progress
has been most perceptible in those classes which form the bulk
and body of armies. England, though, perhaps, she could not
muster an army as large as in former times, has hearts as stout,
and arms as strong as those that gained for her imperishable
glory at Agincourt and Poitiers. The charge at Balaklava, rash
and useless as it may be termed, was worthy of the followers of
the Black Prince.
</p><p>
A theory to be correct, must admit of mathematical demonstration.
The most civilized nations, then, would be the most
effeminate; the most barbarous, the most warlike. And, descending
from nations to individuals, the most cultivated and
refined mind would be accompanied by a deficiency in many of
the manly virtues. Such an assertion is ridiculous. The most
refined and fastidious gentleman has never, as a class, displayed
less courage and fortitude than the rowdy and fighter by profession.
Men sprung from the bosom of the most polished
circles in the most civilized communities, have surpassed the
most warlike barbarians in deeds of hardihood and heroic
valor.
</p><p>
Civilization, therefore, produces no degeneracy; the cultivation
of the arts of peace, no diminution of manly virtues. We have
seen the peaceful burghers of free cities successfully resist the
trained bands of a superior foe; we have seen the artisans and
merchants of Holland invincible to the veteran armies of the
then most powerful prince of Christendom, backed as he was
by the inexhaustible treasures of a newly discovered hemisphere;
we have seen, in our times, troops composed of volunteers who
left their hearthstones to fight for their country, rout incredible
odds of the standing armies of a foe, who, for the last thirty years,
has known no peace.
</p><p>
I believe that an advanced state of civilization, accompanied
by long peace, gives rise to a certain <em>domestication</em> of man, that
is to say, it lays on a polish over the more ferocious or pugnacious
tendencies of his nature; because it, in some measure deprives
him of the opportunities of exercising them, but it cannot
deprive him of the power, should the opportunity present
itself. Let us suppose two brothers born in some of our great
commercial cities, one to enter a counting-house, the other to
settle in the western wilderness. The former might become a
polished, elegant, perhaps even dandified young gentleman; the
other might evince a supreme contempt for all the amenities of
life, be ever ready to draw his bowie-knife or revolver, however
slight the provocation. The country requires the services of
both; a great principle is at stake, and in some battle of Matamoras
or Buena Vista, the two brothers fight side by side; who
will be the braver?
</p><p>
I believe that both individual and national character admit of
a certain degree of pressure by surrounding circumstances;
the pressure removed, the character at once regains its original
form. See with what kindliness the civilized descendant
of the wild Teuton hunter takes to the hunter's life in new
countries, and how soon he learns to despise the comforts of
civilized life and fix his abode in the solitary wilderness. The
Normans had been settled over six centuries in the beautiful
province of France, to which they gave their name; their nobles
had frequented the most polished court in Europe, adapted
themselves to the fashions and requirements of life in a luxurious
metropolis; they themselves had learned to plough the soil
instead of the wave; yet in another hemisphere they at once
regained their ancient habits, and&mdash;as six hundred years before&mdash;became
the most dreaded pirates of the seas they infested; the
savage buccaneers of the Spanish main. I can see no difference
between Lolonnois and his followers, and the terrible men of the
north (his lineal ancestors) that ravaged the shores of the Seine
and the Rhine, and whose name is even yet mentioned with
horror every evening, in the other hemisphere, by thousands of
praying children: "God preserve us from the Northmen."
Morgan, the Welch buccaneer, who, with a thousand men, vanquished
five times as many well-equipped Spaniards, took their
principal cities, Porto Bello and Panama; who tortured his
captives to make them reveal the hiding-place of their treasure;
Morgan might have been&mdash;sixteen centuries notwithstanding&mdash;a
tributary chief to Caractacus, or one of those who opposed
C&aelig;sar's landing in Britain. To make the resemblance still
more complete, the laws and regulations of these lawless bands
were a precise copy of those to which their not more savage
ancestors bound themselves.
</p><p>
I regret that my limited space precludes me from entering
into a more elaborate exposition of the futility of the theory
that civilization, or a long continued state of peace, can produce
physical degeneracy or inaptitude for the ruder duties of the
battle-field; but I believe that what I have said will suffice
to suggest to the thoughtful reader numerous confirmations of
my position; and I may, therefore, now refer him to Mr. Gobineau's
explanation of the term degeneracy.&mdash;H.</p>

The lawless followers of Romulus first coalesced with
the Sabines; the two nations united, then compelled the Albans
to raze their city to the ground, and settle in Rome. Next came
the Latins, to whom, also, a portion of the city was allotted for
settlement. These two conquered nations were, of course, not
permitted the same civil and political privileges as the conquerors,
and, with the exception of a few noble families among
them (which probably had been, from the beginning, in the interests
of the conquerors), these tribes formed the <em>plebs</em>. The
distinction by nations was forgotten, and had become a distinction
of <em>classes</em>. Then began the progress which Mr. Gobineau
describes. The Plebeians first gained their <em>tribunes</em>, who could
protect their interests against the one-sided legislation of the
dominant class; then, the right of discussing and deciding certain
public questions in the <em>comitia</em>, or public assembly. Next,
the law prohibiting intermarriage between the Patricians and
Plebeians was repealed; and thus, in course of time, the government
changed from an oligarchical to a democratic form. I
might go into details, or, I might mention other nations in which
the same process is equally manifest, but I think the above well-known
facts sufficient to bring the author's idea into a clear
light, and illustrate its correctness. The history of the Middle
Ages, the establishment of serfdom and its gradual abolition,
also furnish an analogue.
</p><p>
Wherever we see an hereditary aristocracy (whether called
class or caste), it will be found to originate in a race, which, if
no longer <em>dominant</em>, was once conqueror. Before the Norman
conquest, the English aristocracy was <em>Saxon</em>, there were no
nobles of the ancient British blood, east of Wales; after the
conquest, the aristocracy was <em>Norman</em>, and nine-tenths of the
noble families of England to this day trace, or pretend to trace,
their origin to that stock. The noble French families, anterior to
the Revolution, were almost all of <em>Frankish</em> or <em>Burgundian</em> origin.
The same observation applies everywhere else. In support of
my opinion, I have Niebuhr's great authority: "Wherever there
are castes, they are the consequence of foreign conquest and
subjugation; it is impossible for a nation to submit to such a
system, unless it be compelled by the calamities of a conquest.
By this means only it is, that, contrary to the will of a people,
circumstances arise which afterwards assume the character of a
division into classes or castes."&mdash;<cite>Lect. on Anc. Hist.</cite> (In the
English translation, this passage occurs in vol. i. p. 90.)
</p><p>
In conclusion, I would observe that, whenever it becomes
politic to flatter the mass of the people, the fact of conquest is
denied. Thus, English writers labored hard to prove that William
the Norman did not, in reality, conquer the Saxons. Some
time before the French Revolution, the same was attempted to
be proved in the case of the Germanic tribes in France. L'Abb&eacute;
du Bos, and other writers, taxed their ingenuity to disguise an
obvious fact, and to hide the truth under a pile of ponderous
volumes.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-57" id="Footnote-57"></a> "It has been a favorite thesis with many writers, to pretend
that the Saxon government was, at the time of the conquest, by
no means subverted; that William of Normandy legally acceded
to the throne, and, consequently, to the engagements of the
Saxon kings.... But, if we consider that the manner in
which the public power is formed in a state, is so very essential
a part of its government, and that a thorough change in this
respect was introduced into England by the conquest, we shall
not scruple to allow that a <em>new government</em> was established. Nay,
as almost the whole landed property in the kingdom was, at that
time, transferred to other hands, a new system of criminal justice
introduced, and the language of the law moreover altered, the

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-58" id="Footnote-58"></a> This assertion seems self-evident; it may, however, be not
altogether irrelevant to the subject, to direct attention to a few
facts in illustration of it. Great national calamities like wars,
proscriptions, and revolutions, are like thunderbolts, striking
mostly the objects of greatest elevation. We have seen that a
conquering race generally, for a long time even after the conquest
has been forgotten, forms an aristocracy, which generally
monopolizes the prominent positions. In great political convulsions,
this aristocracy suffers most, often in numbers, and always
in proportion. Thus, at the battle of Cann&aelig;, from 5,000 to 6,000
Roman knights are said to have been slain, and, at all times,
the officer's dress has furnished the most conspicuous, and at
the same time the most important target for the death-dealing
stroke. In those fearful proscriptions, in which Sylla and
Marius vied with each other in wholesale slaughter, the number
of victims included two hundred senators and thirty-three ex-consuls.
That the major part of the rest were prominent men,
and therefore patricians, is obvious from the nature of this persecution.
Revolutions are most often, though not always, produced
by a fermentation among the mass of the population, who
have a heavy score to settle against a class that has domineered
and tyrannized over them. Their fury, therefore, is directed
against this aristocracy. I have now before me a curious document
(first published in the <cite>Prussian State-Gazette</cite>, in 1828, and
for which I am indebted to a little German volume, <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Das Menschengeschlecht
auf seinem Gegenw&auml;rtigen Standpuncte</cite>, by <cite class="author" xml:lang="de" lang="de">Smidt-Phiseldeck</cite>),
giving a list of the victims that fell under the
guillotine by sentence of the revolutionary tribunal, from
August, 1792, to the 27th of July, 1794, in a little less than
two years. The number of victims there given is 2,774. Of
these, 941 are of rank unknown. The remaining 1,833 may be
divided in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-59" id="Footnote-59"></a> The recent insurrection in China has given rise to a great
deal of speculation, and various are the opinions that have
been formed respecting it. But it is now pretty generally
conceded that it is a great national movement, and, therefore,
must ultimately be successful. The history of this insurrection,
by Mr. Callery and Dr. Ivan (one the interpreter, and the other
the physician of the French embassy in China, and both well
known and reliable authorities) leaves no doubt upon the subject.
One of the most significant signs in this movement is
the cutting off the tails, and letting the hair grow, which is
being practised, says Dr. Ivan, in all the great cities, and in the
very teeth of the mandarins. (<cite>Ins. in China</cite>, p. 243.) Let not
the reader smile at this seemingly puerile demonstration, or
underrate its importance. Apparently trivial occurrences are
often the harbingers of the most important events. Were I to
see in the streets of Berlin or Vienna, men with long beards
or hats of a certain shape, I should know that serious troubles
are to be expected; and in proportion to the number of such
men, I should consider the catastrophe more or less near at
hand, and the monarch's crown in danger. When the Lombard
stops smoking in the streets, he meditates a revolution; and
France is comparatively safe, even though every street in Paris
is barricaded, and blood flows in torrents; but when bands march
through the streets singing the <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&ccedil;a ira</em>, we know that to-morrow
the <em>Red Republic</em> will be proclaimed. All these are silent, but
expressive demonstrations of the prevalence of a certain principle
among the masses. Such a one is the cutting off of the tail
among the Chinese. Nor is this a mere emblem. The shaved
crown and the tail are the brands of conquest, a mark of degradation
imposed by the Mantchoos on the subjugated race. The
Chinese have never abandoned the hope of one day expelling
their conquerors, as they did already once before. "Ever since
the fall of the Mings," says Dr. Ivan, "and the accession of the
Mantchoo dynasty, clandestine associations&mdash;these intellectual
laboratories of declining states&mdash;have been incessantly in operation.
The most celebrated of these secret societies, that of
the Triad, or the <em>three principles</em>, commands so extensive and
powerful an organization, that its members may be found throughout
China, and wherever the Chinese emigrate; so that there is
no great exaggeration in the Chinese saying: 'When three of us
are together, the Triad is among us.'" (<cite>Hist. of the Insur. in Ch.</cite>,
p. 112.) Again, the writer says: "The revolutionary impetus
is now so strong, the affairs of the pretender or chief of the insurrection
in so prosperous a condition, that the success of his
cause has nothing to fear from the loss of a battle. It would
require a series of unprecedented reverses to ruin his hopes"
(p. 243 and 245).
</p><p>
I have written this somewhat lengthy note to show that Mr.
Gobineau makes no rash assertion, when he says that the Mantchoos
are about to experience the same fate as their Tartar
predecessors.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-60" id="Footnote-60"></a> The author might have mentioned Russia in illustration of
his position. The star of no nation that we are acquainted with
has suffered an eclipse so total and so protracted, nor re-appeared
with so much brilliancy. Russia, whose history so many
believe to date from the time of Peter the Great only, was one
of the earliest actors on the stage of modern history. Its people
had adopted Christianity when our forefathers were yet
heathens; its princes formed matrimonial alliances with the
monarchs of Byzantine Rome, while Charlemagne was driving
the reluctant Saxon barbarians by thousands into rivers to be
baptized <i>en masse</i>. Russia had magnificent cities before Paris
was more than a collection of hovels on a small island of the
Seine. Its monarchs actually contemplated, and not without
well-founded hopes, the conquest of Constantinople, while the
Norman barges were devastating the coasts and river-shores of
Western Europe. Nay, to that far-off, almost polar region, the
enterprise of the inhabitants had attracted the genius of commerce
and its attendants, prosperity and abundance. One of
the greatest commercial cities of the first centuries after Christ,
one of the first of the Hanse-Towns, was the great city of Novogorod,
the capital of a republic that furnished three hundred
thousand fighting men. But the east of Europe was not destined
to outstrip the west in the great race of progress. The
millions of Tartars, that, locust-like&mdash;but more formidable&mdash;marked
their progress by hopeless devastation, had converted
the greater portion of Asia into a desert, and now sought a new
field for their savage exploits. Russia stood the first brunt, and
its conquest exhausted the strength of the ruthless foe, and
saved Western Europe from overwhelming ruin. In the beginning
of the thirteenth century, five hundred thousand Tartar
horsemen crossed the Ural Mountains. Slow, but gradual, was
their progress. The Russian armies were trampled down by
this countless cavalry. But the resistance must have been a
brave and vigorous one, for few of the invaders lived long enough
to see the conquest. Not until after a desperate struggle of
fifty years, did Russia acknowledge a Tartar master. Nor
were the conquerors even then allowed to enjoy their prize in
peace. For two centuries more, the Russians never remitted
their efforts to regain their independence. Each generation
transmitted to its posterity the remembrance of that precious
treasure, and the care of reconquering it. Nor were their efforts
unsuccessful. Year after year the Tartars saw the prize gliding
from their grasp, and towards the end of the fifteenth century,
we find them driven to the banks of the Volga, and the coasts of
the Black Sea. Russia now began to breathe again. But,
lo! during the long struggle, Pole and Swede had vied with the
Tartar in stripping her of her fairest domains. Her territory
extended scarce two hundred miles, in any direction from Moscow.
Her very name was unknown. Western Europe had forgotten
her. The same causes that established the feudal system
there, had, in the course of two centuries and a half, changed
a nation of freemen into a nation of serfs. The arts of peace
were lost, the military element had gained an undue preponderance,
and a band of soldiers, like the Pretorian Guards of Rome,
made and deposed sovereigns, and shook the state to its very
foundations. Yet here and there a vigorous monarch appeared,
who controlled the fierce element, and directed it to the weal of
the state. Smolensk, the fairest portion of the ancient Russian
domain, was re-conquered from the Pole. The Swede, also, was
forced to disgorge a portion of his spoils. But it was reserved
for Peter the Great and his successors to restore to Russia the
rank she had once held, and to which she was entitled.
</p><p>
I will not further trespass on the patience of the reader, now
that we have arrived at that portion of Russian history which
many think the first. I would merely observe that not only
did Peter add to his empire no territory that had not formerly
belonged to it, but even Catharine, at the first partition
of Poland (I speak not of the subsequent ones), merely
re-united to her dominion what once were integral portions.
The rapid growth of Russia, since she has reassumed her station
among the nations of the earth, is well known. Cities have
sprung up in places where once the nomad had pitched his tent.
A great capital, the handsomest in the world, has risen from the
marsh, within one hundred and fifty years after the founder,
whose name it perpetuates, had laid the first stone. Another
has risen from the ashes, within less than a decade of years
from the time when&mdash;a holocaust on the altar of patriotism&mdash;its
flames announced to the world the vengeance of a nation on an
intemperate aggressor.
</p><p>
Truly, it seems to me, that Mr. Gobineau could not have
chosen a better illustration of his position, that the mere accident
of conquest can not annihilate a nation, than this great
empire, in whose history conquest forms so terrible and so long
an episode, that the portion anterior to it is almost forgotten to
this day.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-61" id="Footnote-61"></a> The author of <cite>Democracy in America</cite> (vol. ii. book 3, ch. 1),
speculating upon the total want of sympathy among the various
classes of an aristocratic community, says: "Each caste has
its own opinions, feelings, rights, manners, and mode of living.
The members of each caste do not resemble the rest of their
fellow-citizens; they do not think and feel in the same manner,
and believe themselves a distinct race.... When the
chroniclers of the Middle Ages, who all belonged to the aristocracy
by birth and education, relate the tragical end of a noble,
their grief flows apace; while they tell, with the utmost indifference,
of massacres and tortures inflicted on the common people.
In this they were actuated by an <em>instinct</em> rather than by a
passion, for they felt no habitual hatred or systematic disdain
for the people: war between the several classes of the community
was not yet declared." The writer gives extracts from
Mme. de Sevign&eacute;'s letters, displaying, to use his own words,
"a cruel jocularity which, in our day, the harshest man writing
to the most insensible person of his acquaintance would not
venture to indulge in; and yet Madame de Sevign&eacute; was not selfish
or cruel; she was passionately attached to her children, and
ever ready to sympathize with her friends, and she treated her
servants and vassals with kindness and indulgence." "Whence
does this arise?" asks M. De Tocqueville; "have we really more
sensibility than our forefathers?" When it is recollected, as
has been pointed out in a previous note, that the nobility of
France were of Germanic, and the peasantry of Celtic origin,
we will find in this an additional proof of the correctness of our
author's theory. Thanks to the revolution, the barriers that
separated the various ranks have been torn down, and continual
intermixture has blended the blood of the Frankish noble and
of the Gallic boor. Wherever this fusion has not yet taken
place, or but imperfectly, M. De Tocqueville's remarks still
apply.&mdash;H.</p>

where morality is at a rather low ebb, the same Bedouine who
cannot resist the slightest pecuniary temptation, would think
herself forever dishonored, if she were joined in lawful wedlock
to the Turk or European, to whose embrace she willingly yields

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-67" id="Footnote-67"></a> The amalgamation of races in South America must indeed
be inconceivable. "I find," says Alex. von Humboldt, in 1826,
"by several statements, that if we estimate the population of
the whole of the Spanish colonies at fourteen or fifteen millions
of souls, there are, in that number, at most, <em>three</em> millions of
pure whites, including about 200,000 Europeans." (<cite>Pers. Nar.</cite>,
vol. i. p. 400.) Of the progress which this mongrel population
have made in civilization, I cannot give a better idea than by an
extract from Dr. Tschudi's work, describing the mode of ploughing
in some parts of Chili. "If a field is to be tilled, it is done
by two natives, who are furnished with long poles, pointed at
one end. The one thrusts his pole, pretty deeply, and in an
oblique direction, into the earth, so that it forms an angle with
the surface of the ground. The other Indian sticks his pole in,
at a little distance, and also obliquely, and he forces it beneath
that of his fellow-laborer, so that the first pole lies, as it were,
upon the second. The first Indian then presses on his pole, and
makes it work on the other, as a lever on its fulcrum, and the
earth is thrown up by the point of the pole. Thus they gradually
advance, until the whole field is furrowed by this laborious
process." (<cite>Dr. Tschudi, Travels in Peru, during the years 1838-1842.</cite>
London, 1847, p. 14.) I really do not think that a
counterpart to this could be found, except, perhaps, in the
manner of working the mines all over South America. Both
Darwin and Tschudi speak of it with surprise. Every pound
of ore is brought out of the shafts on men's shoulders. The
mines are drained of the water accumulating in them, in the
same manner, by means of water-tight bags. Dr. Tschudi describes
the process employed for the amalgamation of the quicksilver
with the silver ore. It is done by causing them to be trodden
together by horses', or human feet. Not only is this method
attended with incredible waste of material, and therefore very
expensive, but it soon kills the horses employed in it, while the
men contract the most fearful, and, generally, incurable diseases!

greatest in that staple which requires the most laborious cultivation.
Thus, sugar requires almost unremitting toil; coffee,
comparatively little. All branches of industry have fearfully

journal (I forget its name and date, but am confident
that the authority is a reliable one), a rather ludicrous account
of an instance of this kind. One of the fathers, who had a little
isolated village under his charge, had occasion to leave his flock
for a time, and his place, unfortunately, could not be replaced
by another. He therefore called the most promising of his
neophytes, and committed to their care the domestic animals
and agricultural implements with which the society had provided
the newly-converted savages, then left them with many
exhortations and instructions. His absence being prolonged
beyond the period anticipated, the Indians thought him dead,
and instituted a grand funeral feast in his honor, at which they
slaughtered all the oxen, and roasted them by fires made of the
ploughs, hoe-handles, etc.; and he arrived just in time to witness
the closing scenes of this mourning ceremony.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-76" id="Footnote-76"></a> The very singular construction of these tumuli, and the
numerous utensils found in them, occupy at this moment the
penetration and talent of American antiquaries. I shall have
occasion, in a subsequent volume, to express an opinion as to
their value in the inquiries about a former civilization; at
present, I shall only say that their almost incredible antiquity
cannot be called in question. Mr. Squier is right in considering
this proved by the fact merely, that the skeletons exhumed
from these tumuli crumble into dust as soon as exposed to the
atmosphere, although the condition of the soil in which they
lie, is the most favorable possible; while the human remains
under the British cromlichs, and which have been interred for
at least eighteen centuries, are perfectly solid. It is easily conceived,
therefore, that between the first possessors of the American
soil and the Lenni-Lenape and other tribes, there is no
connection. Before concluding this note, I cannot refrain from
praising the industry and skill manifested by American scholars
in the study of the antiquities of their immense continent. To
obviate the difficulties arising from the excessive fragility of the
exhumed skulls, many futile attempts were made, but the object
was finally accomplished by pouring into them a bituminous
preparation which instantly solidifies and thus preserves the
osseous parts. This process, which requires many precautions,
and as much skill as promptitude, is said to be generally successful.</p>

As the author observes, all ancient governments were more or
less theocratical. The regulations of castes among the Hindoos
and Egyptians were ascribed to the gods, and even the most
absolute monarch dared not, and could not, transgress the limits
which the immortals had set to his power. This so-called divine
legislation often answered the same purpose as the charters of
modern constitutional monarchies. The authority of the Persian
kings was confined by religious regulations, and this has
always been the case with the sultans of Turkey. Even in
Rome, whose population had a greater tendency for the positive
and practical, than for the things of another world, we find
the traces of theocratical government. The sibylline books, the
augurs, etc., were something more than a vulgar superstition;
and the latter, who could stop or postpone the most important
proceedings, by declaring the omens unpropitious, must have
possessed very considerable political influence, especially in the
earlier periods. The rude, liberty-loving tribes of Scandinavia,
Germany, Gaul, and Britain, were likewise subjected to their
druids, or other priests, without whose permission they never
undertook any important enterprise, whether public or private.
Truly does our author observe, that Christianity came to deliver
mankind from such trammels, though the mistaken or interested
zeal of some of its servants, has so often attempted, and successfully,
to fasten them again. How ill adapted Christianity
would be, even in a political point of view, for a theocratical
formula, is well shown by Mr. Guizot, in his <cite>Hist. of Civilization</cite>,
vol. i. p. 213.&mdash;H.</p>

The communists, socialists, Fourrierites, or whatever names such

wished to restore the social system of the first Christians, who
held all goods in common, etc. Many religious sectaries have
created serious disturbances under the same pretence. It seems,
indeed, reasonable to suppose, that if Christianity had given its
exclusive sanction to any particular social and political system,
it must have been that which the first Christian communities
adopted.&mdash;H.</p>

has greatly promoted the introduction of European habits
among these Indians, is the presence of so great a number of
half-breeds. The man of mixed race&mdash;participating as he does,
to a certain extent, in the enlightenment of the father, without,

the natural link between civilization and barbarism.

their social condition, and change their manners." (<cite>Dem. in Am.</cite>,

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-95" id="Footnote-95"></a> A careful comparison of Mr. Guizot's views with those expressed
by Count Gobineau upon this interesting subject convinced
me that the differences of opinion between these two
investigators required a more careful and minute examination
than the author has thought necessary. With this view, I subjoin
further extracts from the celebrated "<cite>History of Civilization
in Europe</cite>," from which, I think, it will appear that few of the
great truths comprised in the definition of <em>civilization</em> have escaped
the penetration and research of the illustrious writer, but
that, being unable to divest himself of the idea of <em>unity</em> of
civilization, he has necessarily fallen into an error, with which
a great metaphysician justly charges so many reasoners. "It
is hard," says Locke, speaking of the abuse of words, "to find
a discourse written on any subject, especially of controversy,
wherein one shall not observe, if he read with attention, the
same words (and those commonly the most material in the discourse,
and upon which the argument turns) used sometimes for
one collection of simple ideas, and sometimes for another....
A man, in his accompts with another, might with as much
fairness, make the characters of numbers stand sometimes for
one, and sometimes for another collection of units (<i>e. g.</i>, this
character, 3, stand sometimes for three, sometimes for four, and
sometimes for eight), as, in his discourse or reasoning, make the
same words stand for different collections of simple ideas."
</p>
<p class="tbreak">
Mr. Guizot opens his first lecture by declaring his intention
of giving a "general survey of the history of <em>European civilization</em>,
of its <em>origin</em>, its <em>progress</em>, its <em>end</em>, its <em>character</em>. I say European
civilization, because there is evidently so striking a uniformity
in the civilization of the different states of Europe, as
fully to warrant this appellation. Civilization has flowed to
them all from sources so much alike, it is so connected in them
all&mdash;notwithstanding the great differences of time, of place, and
circumstances&mdash;by the same principles, and it tends in them all
to bring about the same results, that no one will doubt of there
being <em>a civilization essentially European</em>."
</p><p>
Here, then, Mr. Guizot acknowledges one great truth contended
for in this volume; he virtually recognizes the fact that
there may be other civilizations, having different origins, a different
progress, different characters, different ends.
</p><p>
"At the same time, it must be observed, that this civilization
cannot be found in&mdash;its history cannot be collected from&mdash;the
history of any single state of Europe. However similar in its
general appearance throughout the whole, its variety is not less
remarkable, nor has it ever yet developed itself completely in
any particular country. Its characteristic features are widely
spread, and we shall be obliged to seek, as occasion may require,
in England, in France, in Germany, in Spain, for the elements
of its history."
</p><p>
This is precisely the idea expressed in my introduction, that
according to the character of a nation, its civilization manifests
itself in various ways; in some, by perfection in the arts, useful
or polite; in others, by development of political forms, and
their practical application, etc. If I had then wished to support
my opinion by a great authority, I should, assuredly, have
quoted Mr. Guizot, who, a few pages further on, says:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Wherever the exterior condition of man becomes enlarged,
quickened, and improved; wherever the intellectual nature of
man distinguishes itself by its energy, brilliancy, and its grandeur;
wherever these signs occur, notwithstanding the gravest
imperfections in the social system, there man proclaims and
applauds a civilization."
</p><p>
"<em>Notwithstanding the gravest imperfections in the social system</em>,"
says Mr. Guizot, yet in the series of hypotheses, quoted in the
text, in which he attempts a negative definition of civilization,
by showing what civilization is <em>not</em>, he virtually makes a political
form the test of civilization.
</p><p>
In another passage, again, he says that civilization "is a
course for humanity to run&mdash;a destiny for it to accomplish.
Nations have transmitted, from age to age, something to their
successors which is never lost, but which grows, and continues
as a common stock, and will thus be carried on to the end of all
things. For my part (he continues), I feel assured that human
nature has such a destiny; that a general civilization pervades
the human race; that at every epoch it augments; and that
there, consequently, is a universal history of civilization to be
written."
</p><p>
It must be obvious to the reader who compares these extracts,
that Mr. Guizot expresses a totally distinct idea or collection of
ideas in each.
</p><p>
First, the civilization of a particular nation, which exists
"wherever the intellectual nature of man distinguishes itself
by its energy, brilliancy, and grandeur." Such a civilization
may flourish, "notwithstanding the greatest imperfections in
the social system."
</p><p>
Secondly, Mr. Guizot's <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau-id&eacute;al</em> of the best, most perfect
civilization, where the political forms insure the greatest happiness,
promote the most rapid&mdash;yet well-regulated&mdash;progress.
</p><p>
Thirdly, a great system of particular civilizations, as that of
Europe, the various elements of which "are connected by the
same principles, and tend all to bring about the same general
results."
</p><p>
Fourthly, a supposed general progress of the whole human
race toward a higher state of perfection.
</p><p>
To all these ideas, provided they are not confounded one with
another, I have already given my assent. (See <cite>Introduction</cite>, <a title="Go to page 51." href="#page51">p. 51</a>.)
With regard to the latter, however, I would observe that it by
no means militates against a belief in the intellectual imparity
of races, and the permanency of this imparity. As in a
society composed of individuals, all enjoy the fruits of the
general progress, though all have not contributed to it in equal
measure, and some not at all: so, in that society, of which we
may suppose the various branches of the human family to be
the members, even the inferior participate more or less in the
benefits of intellectual labor, of which they would have been
incapable. Because I can transport myself with almost the
swiftness of a bird from one place to another, it does not follow
that&mdash;though I profit by Watt's genius&mdash;I could have invented
the steam-engine, or even that I understand the principles upon
which that invention is based.&mdash;H.</p>

<p>As nothing can exceed the difficulty of rendering an abstract

calls the two categories of races respectively feminine and
masculine. But as he "thereby wishes to express nothing but a
mutual fecundation, without ascribing any superiority to either,"
and as the idea seems fully rendered by the words used in the

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-103" id="Footnote-103"></a> One striking observation, in connection with this fact, Mr.
Gobineau has omitted to make, probably not because it escaped
his sagacity, but because he is himself a Roman Catholic.
Wherever the Teutonic element in the population is predominant,
as in Denmark, Sweden, Holland, England, Scotland,
Northern Germany, and the United States, Protestantism prevails;
wherever, on the contrary, the Germanic element is subordinate,
as in portions of Ireland, in South America, and the
South of Europe, Roman Catholicism finds an impregnable
fortress in the hearts of the people. An ethnographical chart,
carefully made out, would indicate the boundaries of each in
Christendom. I do not here mean to assert that the Christian
religion is accessible only to certain races, having already emphatically
expressed my opinion to the contrary. I feel firmly
convinced that a Roman Catholic may be as good and pious a
Christian as a member of any other Christian Church whatever,
but I see in this fact the demonstration of that leading characteristic
of the Germanic races&mdash;independence of thought, which
incites them to seek for truth, even in religion, for themselves;
to investigate everything, and take nothing upon trust.

I have, moreover, in favor of my position, the high authority
of Mr. Macaulay: "The Reformation," says that distinguished
essayist and historian, "was a national as well as a moral
revolt. It had been not only an insurrection of the laity
against the clergy, but <em>also an insurrection of the great German
race against an alien domination</em>. It is a most significant
circumstance, that no large society of which the tongue is not
Teutonic, has ever turned Protestant, and that, wherever a
language derived from ancient Rome is spoken, the religion of
modern Rome to this day prevails." (<cite>Hist. of England</cite>, vol. i.
p. 53.)&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-104" id="Footnote-104"></a> Thus Sparta and Athens, respectively, stood at the head of
the oligarchic and democratic parties, and the alternate preponderance
of either of the two often inundated each state with
blood. Yet Sparta and Athens, and the partisans of each in
every state, possessed the spirit of liberty and independence in
an equal degree. Themistocles and Aristides, the two great
party leaders of Athens, vied with each other in patriotism.

This uniformity of general views and purpose, Mr. De Tocqueville
found in the United States, and he correctly deduces from
it the conclusion that "though the citizens are divided into 24
(31) distinct sovereignties, they, nevertheless, constitute a
single nation, and form more truly a state of society, than many
peoples of Europe, living under the same legislation, and the
same prince." (Vol. i. p. 425.) This is an observation which
Europeans make last, because they do not find it at home; and
in return, it prevents the American from acquiring a clear conception
of the state of Europe, because he thinks the disputes
there involve no deeper questions than the disputes around him.
In certain fundamental principles, all Americans agree, to whatever
party they may belong; certain general characteristics belong
to them all, whatever be the differences of taste, and individual
preferences; it is not so in Europe&mdash;England, perhaps,
excepted, and Sweden and Denmark. But I will not anticipate
the author.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-106" id="Footnote-106"></a> China has no hereditary nobility. The class of mandarins
is composed of those who have received diplomas in the great
colleges with which the country abounds. A decree of the Emperor
<em class="smcap">Jin-Tsoung</em>, who reigned from 1023 to 1063, regulated
the modes of examination, to which all, indiscriminately, are
admitted. The candidates are examined more than once, and
every precaution is taken to prevent frauds. Thus, the son of
the poorest peasant may become a mandarin, but, as he afterwards
is dependent on the emperor for office or employment,
this dignity is often of but little practical value. Still, there
are numerous instances on record, in the history of China, of
men who have risen from the lowest ranks to the first offices of
the State, and even to the imperial dignity. (See <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pauthier's Histoire

or four volumes of any ordinary work of the octavo size and
shape, may be had for a sum equivalent to two shillings. A
Canton bookseller's manuscript catalogue marked the price of
the four books of Confucius, including the commentary, at a
price rather under half a crown. The cheapness of their common
literature is occasioned partly by the mode of printing, but
partly also by the low price of paper."
</p><p>
These are Canton prices; in the interior of the empire, books
are still cheaper, even in proportion to the value of money in
China. Their classic works are sold at a proportionably lower
price than the very refuse of our literature. A pamphlet, or
small tale, may be bought for a sapeck, about the seventeenth
part of a cent; an ordinary novel, for a little more or less than
one cent.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-108" id="Footnote-108"></a> There are certain offences for which the punishment is remitted,
if the culprit is able to explain lucidly the nature and
object of the law respecting them. (See <cite>Huc's Trav. in China</cite>, vol.
ii. p. 252.) In the same place, Mr. Huc bears witness to the
correctness of our author's assertion. "Measures are taken,"
says he, "not only to enable the magistrates to understand perfectly
the laws they are called upon to apply, but also to diffuse
a knowledge of them among the people at large. All persons in
the employment of the government, are ordered to make the code
their particular study; and a special enactment provides, that
at certain periods, all officers, in all localities, shall be examined
upon their knowledge of the laws by their respective superiors;
and if their answers are not satisfactory, they are punished, the
high officials by the retention of a month's pay; the inferior
ones by forty strokes of the bamboo." It must not be imagined
that Mr. Huc speaks of the Chinese in the spirit of a panegyrist.
Any one who reads this highly instructive and amusing book
(now accessible to English readers by a translation), will soon
be convinced of the contrary. He seldom speaks of them to
praise them.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-113" id="Footnote-113"></a> Mr. Gobineau's remarks apply with equal, and, in some
cases, with greater force, to other portions of Europe, as I had
myself ample means for observing. I have always considered
the character of the European peasantry as the most difficult
problem in the social system of those countries. Institutions
cannot in all cases account for it. In Germany, for instance,
education is general and even compulsory: I have never met a
man under thirty that could not read and write. Yet, each
place has its local <i>patois</i>, which no rustic abandons, for it would
be deemed by his companions a most insufferable affectation.
I have heard ministers in the pulpit use local dialects, of which
there are over five hundred in Germany alone, and most of them
widely different. Together with their <i>patois</i>, the rustics preserve
their local costumes, which mostly date from the Middle
Ages. But the peculiarity of their manners, customs, and
modes of thinking, is still more striking. Their superstitions
are often of the darkest, and, at best, of the most pitiable nature.
I have seen hundreds of poor creatures, males and females,
on their pilgrimage to some far distant shrine in expiation
of their own sins or those of others who pay them to go in
their place. On these expeditions they start in great numbers,
chanting <i>Aves</i> on the way the whole day long, so that you can
hear a large band of them for miles. Each carries a bag on
the back or head, containing their whole stock of provisions for
a journey of generally from one to two weeks. At night, they
sleep in barns, or on stacks of hay in the fields. If you converse
with them, you will find them imbued with superstitions
absolutely idolatrous. Yet they all know how to read and
write. The perfect isolation in which these creatures live from
the world, despite that knowledge, is altogether inconceivable to
an American. As Mr. Gobineau says of the French peasants,
they believe themselves a distinct race. There is little or no
discontent among them; the revolutionary fire finds but scanty
fuel among these rural populations. But they look upon those
who govern and make the laws as upon different beings, created
especially for that purpose; the principles which regulate
their private conduct, the whole sphere of their ideas, are peculiar
to themselves. In one word, they form, not a class, but a
caste, with lines of demarcation as clearly defined as the castes
of India. I have said before that this is not from want of education;
nor can any other explanation of the mystery be found.
It is not poverty, for among these rustics there are many
wealthy people, and, in general, they are not so poor as the
lower classes in cities. Nor do the laws restrain them within
the limits of a caste. In Germany, hereditary aristocracy is
almost obsolete. The ranks of the actual aristocracy are daily
recruited from the burgher classes. The highest offices of the
various states are often found in possession of untitled men, or
men with newly created titles. The colleges and universities
are open to all, and great facilities are afforded even to the
poorest. Yet these differences between various parts of the
population remain, and this generally in those localities which
the ethnographer describes as strongly tinctured with non-Teutonic
elements.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-115" id="Footnote-115"></a> A few years ago, a church-warden was to be elected in a
very small and very obscure parish of French Brittany, that
part of the former province which the real Britons used to call
the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pays Gallais</em>, or Gallic land. The electors, who were all
peasants, deliberated two days without being able to agree upon
a selection, because the candidate, a very honest, wealthy, and
highly respected man and a good Christian, was a <em>foreigner</em>.
Now, this <em>foreigner</em> was born in the locality, and his father had
resided there before him, and had also been born there, but it
was recollected that his grandfather, who had been dead many
years, and whom no one in the assembly had known, came from
somewhere else.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-116" id="Footnote-116"></a> This is no exaggeration, as every one acquainted with
French history knows. In the great revolution of the last century,
the peasantry of France took no interest and no part. In
the Vend&eacute;e, indeed, they fought, and fought bravely, for the
ancient forms, their king, and their feudatory lords. Everywhere
else, the rural districts remained in perfect apathy. The
revolutions since then have been decided in Paris. The <i>&eacute;meutes</i>
seldom extended beyond the walls of the great cities. It is a well-known
fact, that in many of the rural districts, the peasants did
not hear of the expulsion of the Bourbon dynasty, until years
afterwards, and even then had no conception of the nature of the
change. Bourbon, Orleans, Republic, are words, to them, of
no definite meaning. The only name that can rouse them from
their apathy, is "Napoleon." At that sound, the Gallic heart
thrills with enthusiasm and thirst for glory. Hence the
unparalleled success with which the present emperor has appealed
to universal suffrage.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-117" id="Footnote-117"></a> It is not generally appreciated how much we are indebted
to Oriental civilizations for our lighter and more graceful literature.
Our first works of fiction were translations or paraphrases
of Eastern tales introduced into Western Europe by the
returning crusaders. The songs of the troubadour, the many-tomed
romances of the Middle Ages&mdash;those ponderous sires of
modern novels&mdash;all emanated from that source. The works of
Dante, Tasso, Ariosto, Boccacio, and nearer home, of Chaucer
and Spenser, are incontestable proofs of this fact. Even Milton
himself drew from the inexhaustible stores of Eastern
legends and romances. Our fairy tales, and almost all of our
most graceful lyric poesy, that is not borrowed from Greece, is
of Persian origin. Almost every popular poet of England and
the continent has invoked the Oriental muse, none more successfully
than Southey and Moore. It would be useless to allude
to the immense popularity of acknowledged versions of Oriental
literature, such as the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, the Apologues,
Allegories, &amp;c. What we do not owe to the East, we
have taken from the Greeks. Even to this day, Grecian mythology
is the never-failing resource of the lyric poet, and so familiar
has that graceful imagery become to us, that we introduce
it, often <i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i>, even in our colloquial language.

In metaphysics, also, we have confessedly done little more
than revive the labors of the Greeks.&mdash;H.</p>

his own facts disprove, and which is still everywhere received
without examination, viz: that cultivation can change the form
or size of the head, either of individuals or races; an opinion,
in support of which, no facts whatever can be adduced. The
heads of the barbarous races of Europe were precisely the same
as those of civilized Europe in our day; this is proven by the
disinterred crania of ancient races, and by other facts. Nor do
we see around us among the uneducated, heads inferior in form
and size to those of the more privileged classes. Does any one
pretend that the nobility of England, which has been an educated
class for centuries, have larger heads, or more intelligence
than the ignoble? On the contrary, does not most of the talent
of England spring up from plebeian ranks? Wherever civilization
has been brought to a population of the white race, they
have accepted it at once&mdash;their heads required no development.
Where, on the contrary, it has been carried to Negroes, Mongols,
and Indians, they have rejected it. Egyptians and Hindoos
have small heads, but we know little of the early history
of their civilization. Egyptian monuments prove that the early
people and language of Egypt were strongly impregnated with
Semitic elements. Latham has shown that the Sanscrit language
was carried <em>from</em> Europe to India, and probably civilization
with it.

I have looked in vain for twenty years for evidence to prove
that cultivation could enlarge a <em>brain</em>, while it expands the
mind. The head of a boy at twelve is as large as it ever is.&mdash;N.</p>

concise and excellent synopsis of his views, which I borrow
from Dr. Kneeland's <cite>Introduction to Hamilton Smith's Natural
History of Man</cite>, may not be unacceptable: "There are, on
microscopical examination, three prevailing forms of the transverse
section of the filament, viz: the cylindrical, the oval, and
the eccentrically elliptical. There are also three directions in
which it pierces the epidermis. The straight and lank, the
flowing or curled, and the crisped or frizzled, differ respectively
as to the angle which the filament makes with the skin on leaving
it. The cylindrical and oval pile has an oblique angle of
inclination. The eccentrically elliptical pierces the epidermis
at right angles, and lies perpendicularly in the dermis. The
hair of the white man is oval; that of the Choctaw, and some
other American Indians, is cylindrical; that of the negro is
eccentrically elliptical or flat. The hair of the white man has,
beside its cortex and intermediate fibres, a central canal, which
contains the coloring matter when present. The pile of the
negro has no central canal, and the coloring matter is diffused,
when present, either throughout the cortex or the intermediate
fibres. Hair, according to these observations, is more complex
in its structure than wool. In hair, the enveloping scales are
comparatively few, with smooth surfaces, rounded at their
points, and closely embracing the shaft. In wool, they are
numerous, rough, sharp-pointed, and project from the shaft.
<em>Hence, the hair of the white man will not felt, that of the negro
will.</em> In this respect, therefore, it comes near to true wool"&mdash;pp.

This hypothesis is singularly corroborated by a passage in the
relations of the traveller Rubruquis, who was sent by St. Louis
as ambassador to the sovereign of the Mongols. "I was struck,"
says the worthy monk, "with the prince's resemblance to the
deceased <em>M. John de Beaumont</em>, whose complexion was equally
fresh and colored." Alexander Von Humboldt, justly interested
by this remark, adds: "This physiognomical observation acquires
importance, when we recollect that the monarch here
spoken of belonged to the family of Tchinguiz, who were really
of Turkish, not of Mogul origin." And pursuing this trace, the
great <i>savant</i> finds another corroborating fact: "The absence of
Mongolian features," says he, "strikes us also in the portraits
which we possess of the Baburides, the conquerors of India."

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-158" id="Footnote-158"></a> It will be seen that Mr. Gobineau differs, in the date he
gives of the institution of the Janissaries, from all other European
writers, who unanimously ascribe the establishment of this
corps to Mourad I., the third prince of the line of Othman.
This error, into which Gibbon himself has fallen, originated
with Cantemir: but the concurrent testimony of every Turkish
historian fixes the epoch of their formation and consecration by
the Dervish Hadji-Becktash, to the reign of Orkhan, the father
of Mourad, who, in 1328, enrolled a body of Christian youths
as soldiers under this name (which signifies, "new regulars"),
by the advice of his cousin Tchenderli, to whose councils the
wise and simple regulations of the infant empire are chiefly
attributed. Their number was at first only a thousand; but it
was greatly augmented when Mourad, in 1361, appropriated to
this service, by an edict, the <em>imperial fifth</em> of the European captives
taken in the war&mdash;a measure which has been generally
confounded with the first enrolment of the corps. At the accession
of Soliman the Magnificent, their effective strength had
reached 40,000; and under Mohammed IV., in the middle of
the seventeenth century, that number was more than doubled.
But though the original composition of the Janissaries is related
by every writer who has treated of them, it has not been
so generally noticed that for more than two centuries and a half
not a single native Turk was admitted into their ranks, which
were recruited, like those of the Mamelukes, solely by the continual
supply of Christian slaves, at first captives of tender age
taken in war, and afterwards, when this source proved inadequate
to the increased demand, by an annual levy among the
children of the lower orders of Christians throughout the empire&mdash;a
dreadful tax, frequently alluded to by Busbequius, and
which did not finally cease till the reign of Mohammed IV.
</p><p>
At a later period, when the Krim Tartars became vassals of
the Porte, the yearly inroads of the fierce cavalry of that nation
into the southern provinces of Russia, were principally instrumental
in replenishing this nursery of soldiers; and Fletcher,
who was ambassador from Queen Elizabeth to Ivan the Terrible,
describes, in his quaint language, the method pursued in these
depredations: "The chief bootie the Tartars seeke for in all
their warres, is to get store of captives, specially young boyes
and girles, whom they sell to the Turkes, or other, their neighbours.
To this purpose, they take with them great baskets,
made like bakers' panniers, <em>to carrie them tenderly</em>; and if any
of them happens to tyre, or bee sicke on the way, they dash
him against the ground, or some tree, and so leave him dead."
(<cite>Purchas's Pilgrims</cite>, vol. iii. p. 441.)
</p><p>
The boys, thus procured from various quarters, were assembled
at Constantinople, where, after a general inspection, those
whose personal advantages or indications of superior talent distinguished
them from the crowd, were set aside as pages of the
seraglio or Mamelukes in the households of the pashas and other
officers, whence in due time they were promoted to military
commands or other appointments: but the remaining multitude
were given severally in charge to peasants or artisans of Turkish
race, principally in Anatolia, by whom they were trained up,
till they approached the age of manhood, in the tenets of the
Moslem faith, and inured to all the privations and toils of a
hardy and laborious life. After this severe probation, they
were again transferred to the capital, and enrolled in the different
<em>odas</em> or regiments; and here their military education commenced.&mdash;H.</p>

The Magyar's wealth consists in his herds, or, if he owns

in the study of history had not the slightest apprehension.
Alexander Von Humboldt makes a very important remark
upon this subject, in speaking of the Kirghis-Kazakes, mentioned
by Menander of Byzant, and Constantine Porphyrogenetus;
and he shows conclusively that the Kirghis (<ins class="greek" title="Transliteration: cherchis" xml:lang="el" lang="el">&chi;&epsilon;&rho;&chi;&iota;&sigmaf;</ins>) concubine

not belong, any more than she, to the Mongolian race. (Vide

It is well known that Spain contains a population composed of
very dissimilar ethnical elements, and that the inhabitants of its
various provinces differ essentially, not only in physical appearance,
but still more in mental characteristics. As in all newly-settled
countries, immigrants from the same locality are apt to
select the same spot, the extensive Spanish possessions on this
continent were colonized, each respectively, by some particular
province in the mother country. Thus the Biscayans settled
Mexico; the Andalusians and natives of the Canary Islands,
Venezuela; the Catalonians, Buenos Ayres; the Castillians,
Peru, etc. Although centuries have elapsed since these original
settlements, and although the character of the Spanish Americans
must have been variously modified by the physical nature
of their new homes, whether situated in the vicinity of coasts,
or of mining districts, or in isolated table-lands, or in fertile
valleys; notwithstanding all this, the great traveller and experienced
observer still clearly recognizes in the character of the
various populations of South America, the distinctive peculiarities
of the original settlers. Says he: "The Andalusians and
Canarians of Venezuela, the Mountaineers and the Biscayans
of Mexico, the Catalonians of Buenos Ayres, evince considerable
differences in their aptitude for agriculture, for the mechanical
arts, for commerce, and for all objects connected with
intellectual development. <em>Each of these races has preserved, in
the new, as in the old world, the shades that constitute its national
physiognomy</em>; its asperity or mildness of character; its freedom
from sordid feelings, or its excessive love of gain; its social
hospitality, or its taste of solitude.... In the inhabitants of
Caracas, Santa F&eacute;, Quito, and Buenos Ayres, we still recognize
the features that belong to the race of the first settlers."&mdash;<cite>Personal

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-167" id="Footnote-167"></a> I have already alluded to the classification adopted by Mr.
Latham, the great ethnographer, which, though different in the
designations, is precisely similar to that of Mr. Gobineau.
Hamilton Smith also comes to the conclusion that, "as there are
only three varieties who attain the typical standard, we have in
them the foundation of that number being exclusively aboriginal."
He therefore divides the races of men into three
classes, which he calls "typical forms," and which nearly correspond
to Mr. Gobineau's and Mr. Latham's "primary varieties."
But, notwithstanding this weight of authorities against
me, I cannot entirely agree as to the correctness of this classification.
Fewer objections seem to me to lie against that proposed
by Van Amringe, which I recommend to the consideration
of the reader, and, though perhaps out of place in a mere
foot-note, subjoin at full length. It must be remembered that
the author of this system, though he uses the word species to
distinguish the various groups, is one of the advocates for
<em>unity of origin</em>. (The words <em>Japhetic</em> and <em>Shemitic</em> are also employed
in a sense somewhat different from that which common
usage has assigned them.)

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-169" id="Footnote-169"></a> This may be so in our eyes. It is natural for us to think
those the most pleasing in appearance, that closest resemble our
own type. But were an African to institute a comparative scale
of beauty, would he not place his own race highest, and declare
that "all races rose in the scale of beauty in proportion to the
perfectness of the development" of African features? I think
it extremely probable&mdash;nay, positively certain.
</p><p>
Mr. Hamilton Smith takes the same side as the author. "It
is a mistaken notion," says he, "to believe that the standard
contour of beauty and form differs materially in any country.
Fashion may have the influence of setting up certain deformities
for perfections, both at Pekin and at Paris, but they are invariably
apologies which national pride offers for its own defects.
The youthful beauty of Canton would be handsome (?) in London,"
etc.
</p><p>
Mr. Van Amringe, on the contrary, after a careful examination
of the facts brought to light by travellers and other investigators,
comes to the conclusion that "the standard of beauty in
the different species (see <a title="Go to Page 371." href="#page371">p. 371</a>, <cite><a title="Go to Footnote 167 on Page 371." href="#Footnote-167">note</a></cite>) of man is wholly different,
physically, morally, and intellectually. Consequently, that taste
for personal beauty in each species is incompatible with the perception
of sexual beauty out of the species." (<cite>Op. cit.</cite>, p. 656.)
"A difference of taste for sexual beauty in the several races of
men is the great natural law which has been instrumental in
separating them, and keeping them distinct, more effectually
than mountains, deserts, or oceans. This separation has been
perfect for the whole historic period, and continues to be now
as wide as it is or has been in any distinct species of animals.
Why has this been so? Did prejudice operate four thousand
years ago exactly as it does now? If it did not, how came the
races to separate into distinct masses at the very earliest known
period, and, either voluntarily or by force, take up distinct geographical
abodes?" (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, pp. 41 and 42.)&mdash;H.</p>

persons unreflectingly conclude that they were always so; which
would presuppose that the Chinese were placed upon earth with
the faculty of making porcelain, gunpowder, paper, etc., somewhat
after the manner in which bees make their cells. But in
the annals of the Chinese empire, the date of many of their principal
inventions is distinctly recorded. There was a long period
of vigorous intellectual activity among that singular people, a
period during which good books were written, and ingenious inventions
made in rapid succession. This period has ceased, but
the Chinese are not therefore stationary. They are <em>retrograding</em>.
No Chinese workman can now make porcelain equal to that of
former ages, which consequently bears an exorbitant price as an
object of <i>virt&ucirc;</i>. The secret of many of their arts has been lost,
the practice of all is gradually deteriorating. No book of any
note has been written these hundreds of years in that great
empire. Hence their passionate attachment to everything old,
which is not, as is so generally presumed, the <em>cause</em> of their
stagnation: it is the <em>sign</em> of intellectual decadence, and the
brake which prevents a still more rapid descent. Whenever a
nation begins to extravagantly prize the productions of preceding
ages, it is a confession that it can no longer equal them: it has
begun to retrograde. But the very retrogression is a proof that
there once was an opposite movement.</p>

then that, in Northern Germany, thousands of ladies of the first
families sacrificed their health, and, in too many instances, their
lives, to the Christian duty of charity. Many of the noble
houses still mourn the loss of some fair matron or maiden, who
fell a victim to her self-devotion. In the late war between Denmark
and Prussia, the Danish ladies displayed an equal zeal.
Scutari also will be remembered in after ages as a monument of
what the women of our race can do. But why revert to the
past, and to distant scenes? Have we not daily proofs around
us that the heroic virtues of by-gone ages still live in ours?</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-181" id="Footnote-181"></a> The word <em>Arab</em> is here used instead of the more common,
but less correct, term <em>Saracen</em>, which was the general appellation
bestowed on the first propagators of the Islam by the
Greeks and Latins. The Arab civilization reached its culminating
point about the reign of Harun al Rashid. At that time, it
comprised nearly all that remained of the arts and sciences of
former ages. The splendor and magnificence for which it was
distinguished, is even yet the theme of romancers and poets; and
may be discerned to this day in the voluptuous and gorgeous
modes of life among the higher classes in those countries where
it still survives, as well as in the remains of Arab architecture
in Spain, the best preserved and most beautiful of which is
the well-known Alhambra. Though the Arab civilization had a
decidedly sensual tendency and character, it was not without
great benefits to mankind. From it our forefathers learned
some valuable secrets of agriculture, and the first lessons in
horticulture. The peach, the pear, the apricot, the finer varieties
of apples and plums, and nearly all of our most valued
fruits were brought into Western and Central Europe by the
returning crusaders from the land of the Saracens. Many valuable
processes of manufacture, and especially of the art of
working metals, are derived from the same source. In the
science of medicine, the Arabs laid the foundation of that noble
structure we now admire. Though they were prevented by religious
scruples from dissecting the human body, and, therefore,
remained in ignorance of the most important facts of anatomy,
they brought to light innumerable secrets of the healing powers
in the vegetable kingdom; they first practised the art of distillation
and of chemical analysis. They were the beginners of
the science of Chemistry, to which they gave its name, and in
which many of the commonest technical terms (such as alkali,
alembic, alcohol, and many others), still attest their labors. In
mathematical science they were no less industrious. To them
we owe that simple and useful method which so greatly facilitates
the more complex processes of calculation, without which,
indeed, some of them would be impossible, and which still retains
its Arabic name&mdash;Algebra. But what is more, to them
we owe our system of notation, so vastly superior to that of the
Greeks and Romans, so admirable in its efficacy and simplicity,
that it has made arithmetic accessible to the humblest understanding;
at the present time, the whole Christian world uses
Arabic numerals.&mdash;H.</p>

how unsuccessful these efforts, backed, though they were, by

therefore, merely draw attention to familiar facts, with a view
to refresh the reader's memory, not to instruct him.
</p><p>
The famous Arabian queen was the widow of Odenathus, of
Palmyra, who bequeathed to her his dignity as <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, or protector
of the Eastern dominions of Rome. It soon, however,
became apparent that she disdained to owe allegiance to the
Roman emperors, and aimed at establishing a new great empire
for herself and her descendants. Though the most accomplished,
as well as the most beautiful woman of her time, she
led her armies in person, and was so eminently successful in
her military enterprises that she soon extended her dominion
from the Euphrates to the Nile. Palmyra thus became the centre
and capital of a vast empire, which, as Mr. Gobineau observes,
rivalled and even threatened Rome itself. She was,
however, defeated by Aurelian, and, in A. D. 273, graced the
triumph of her conqueror on his return to Rome.
</p><p>
The former splendor of the now deserted Palmyra is attested
by the magnificent ruins which still form an inexhaustible theme
for the admiration of the traveller and antiquarian.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-187" id="Footnote-187"></a> Though the mass of the nation were ignorant of letters, the
Arabs had already before Mohammed's times some famous writers.
They had even made voyages of discovery, in which they
went as far as China. The earliest, and, as modern researches
have proved, the most truthful, account of the manners and
customs of that country is by Arab writers.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-188" id="Footnote-188"></a> At the time of the appearance of the false prophet, Arabia
contained within its bosom every then known religious sect. This
was owing not only to the central position of that country, but
also to the liberty which was then as now a prerogative of the
Arab. Among them every one was free to select or compose
for himself his own private religion. While the adjacent countries
were shaken by the storms of conquest and tyranny, the
persecuted sects fled to the happy land where they might profess
what they thought, and practice what they professed.
</p><p>
A religious persecution had driven from Persia many who professed
the religion of the ancient Magi. The Jews also were
early settlers in Arabia. Seven centuries before the death of
Mohammed they had firmly established themselves there. The
destruction of Jerusalem brought still greater numbers of these
industrious exiles, who at once erected synagogues, and to protect
the wealth they rapidly acquired, built and garrisoned
strongly fortified towns in various portions of the wilderness.
The Bible had at an early day been translated into the Arabic
tongue. Christian missionaries were not wanting, and their
active zeal was eminently successful. Several of the Arab tribes
had become converts. There were Christian churches in Yemen;
the states of Hira and Gassan were under the jurisdiction of
Jacobite and Nestorian bishops. The various heretical sects
found shelter and safety among the hospitable Arabs. But this
very fact proved detrimental to the progress of the Christian
religion, and opened the path for the creed of Mohammed. So
many and various were the Christian sects that crowded together
in that country, and so widely departed from the true spirit of
Christianity were some of them, that bitter hostilities sprung up
among them, and their religion fell into contempt. The Eastern
Christians of the seventh century had insensibly relapsed into a
semblance of paganism, one of the sects (the Collyridian heretics)
had even gone so far as to invest the virgin Mary with the name
and honors of a goddess. This is what the author alludes to in
saying that Christianity was losing favor in Arabia at the time
of the appearance of Mohammed.&mdash;H.</p>

of sects had sprung up about that time to distress and harass the
Church. It is not so generally appreciated, however, that for
the first hundred years, the progress of Islamism was almost
exclusively at the expense of Christianity. The whole of the
present Ottoman empire, and almost the whole northern coast
of Africa were previously Christian countries. Whether the loss
is greatly to be regretted, I know not, for the Syrians and Egyptians,
from being very indifferent Christians, became good Mohammedans.
These populations were to the Christian Church
like a cankered limb, the lopping off of which may have been
ordained by an all-wise Providence for the salvation of what was
yet sound in the body.&mdash;H.</p>

it is unselecting. He eats everything, and I have good reasons
for asserting, that odors the most disagreeable to us, are positively
pleasant to him." (Pruner, <cite>Op. cit.</cite>, vol. i. p. 133.)
</p><p>
Mr. Pruner's assertions would, I think, be corroborated by
every one who has lived much among the negroes. It is a
notorious fact that the blacks on our southern plantations eat
every animal they can lay hold of. I have seen them discuss a
piece of fox, or the still more strongly flavored pole-cat, with
evident relish. Nay, on one occasion, I have known a party of
negroes feast on an alligator for a whole week, during which
time they bartered their allowance of meat for trinkets. Upon
my expressing surprise at so strange a repast, I was assured
that it was by no means uncommon; that it was a favorite viand of
the negroes in their native country, and that even here they often
killed them with the prospect of a savory roast or stew. I am
aware that some persons north of the Mason's &amp; Dixon's line
might be disposed to explain this by asserting that <em>hunger</em> drove
them to such extremities; but I can testify, from my own observation,
that this is not the case. In the instances I have
mentioned, and in many others which are too repulsive to be
committed to paper, the banqueters were well fed, and evidently
made such a feast from choice. There are, in the Southern
States, many of the poor white population who are neither so
well clothed nor so well fed as these negroes were, and yet I
never heard of their resorting to such dishes.
</p><p>
In regard to the negro's fondness for odors, I am less qualified
to speak from my own observations, but nearly every description
of the manners of his native climes that I have read,
mentioned the fact of their besmearing themselves with the
strong musky fluid secreted by many animals&mdash;the alligator,
for instance. And I remember having heard woodsmen in the
South say, that while the white man shuns the polecat more
than he does the rattlesnake, and will make a considerable circuit
to get out of its way, the negro is but little afraid of this
formidable animal and its nauseous weapon.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-193" id="Footnote-193"></a> This is illustrated by many of their practices in their natural
state. For instance, the well-known custom of putting to death,
at the demise of some prince or great man, a number&mdash;corresponding
with the rank of the deceased&mdash;of his slaves, in order
that they may wait upon him in the other world. Hundreds of
poor creatures are often thus massacred at the funeral celebrations
in honor of some king or ruler. Yet it would be unjust
to call the negro ferocious or cruel. It merely proves the slight
estimation in which he holds human life.&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-194" id="Footnote-194"></a> There is a callousness in the negro, which strikingly distinguishes
him from the whites, though it is possessed in perhaps
an equal degree by other races. I borrow from Mr. Van Amringe's
<cite>Nat. Hist. of Man</cite>, a few remarks on this subject by Dr.
Mosely, in his <cite>Treatise on Tropical Diseases</cite>: "Negroes," says
the Doctor, "whatever the cause may be, are devoid of sensibility
(physical) to a surprising degree. They are not subject to
nervous diseases. They sleep sound in every disease, nor does
any mental disturbance ever keep them awake. They bear chirurgical
operations much better than white people, and what
would be the cause of insupportable pain to a white man, a negro
would almost disregard. I have amputated the legs of many
negroes, who have held the upper part of the limb themselves."
Every southern planter, and every physician of experience in
the South, could bear witness to these facts.&mdash;H.</p>

Tschudi is a Swiss naturalist of undoubted reputation, an experienced
philosophic observer, and a candid seeker for truth.
His opinion is somewhat harsher than would be that of a man
who had resided among that class all his life, but it nevertheless
contains some valuable truths, and is, at least, curious on
account of the source whence it comes.
</p><p>
"In Lima, and, indeed, throughout the whole of Peru, the
free negroes are a plague to society. Too indolent to support
themselves by laborious industry, they readily fall into any dishonest
means of getting money. Almost all the robbers that
infest the roads on the coast of Peru are free negroes. Dishonesty
seems to be a part of their very nature; and, moreover,
all their tastes and inclinations are coarse and sensual. Many
warm defenders excuse these qualities by ascribing them to the
want of education, the recollection of slavery, the spirit of revenge,
etc. But I here speak of free-born negroes, who are
admitted into the houses of wealthy families, who, from their
early childhood, have received as good an education as falls to
the share of many of the white Creoles&mdash;who are treated with
kindness and liberally remunerated, and yet they do not differ
from their half-savage brethren who are shut out from these
advantages. If the negro has learned to read and write, and has
thereby made some little advance in education, he is transformed
into a conceited coxcomb, who, instead of plundering travellers
on the highway, finds in city life a sphere for the indulgence of
his evil propensities.... My opinion is, that the negroes,
in respect to capability for mental improvement, are far behind
the Europeans; and that, considered in the aggregate, they will
not, even with the advantages of careful education, attain a very
high degree of cultivation. This is apparent from the structure
of the skull, on which depends the development of the brain,
and which, in the negro, approximates closely to the animal
form. The imitative faculty of the monkey is highly developed
in the negro, who readily seizes anything merely mechanical,
whilst things demanding intelligence are beyond his reach.
Sensuality is the impulse which controls the thoughts, the acts,
the whole existence of the negroes. To them, freedom can be
only nominal, for if they conduct themselves well, it is because
they are compelled, not because they are inclined to do so.
Herein lie at once the cause of, and the apology for, their bad
character." (<cite>Travels in Peru</cite>, London, 1848, p. 110, <i>et passim</i>.)&mdash;H.</p>

<li class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote-197" id="Footnote-197"></a> As many of the terms of modern ethnography have not yet
found their way into the dictionaries, I shall offer a short explanation
of the meaning of this word, for the benefit of those
readers who have not paid particular attention to that science.
</p><p>
The word "Arian" is derived from <em>Aryas</em> or <ins class="greek" title="Transliteration: Arioi" xml:lang="el" lang="el">&Alpha;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</ins>, respectively
the indigenous and the Greek designation of the ancient Medes,
and is applied to a race, or rather a family of races, whose original
ethnological area is not as yet accurately defined, but who
have gradually spread from the centre of Asia to the mouth of
the Ganges, to the British Isles, and the northern extremities of
Scandinavia. To this family of races belong, among others,
the ancient Medes and Persians, the white conquerors of India
(now forming the caste of the Brahmins), <em>and the Germanic races</em>.
The whole group is often called Indo-European. The affinities
between the Greek and the German languages had long been an
interesting question to philologists; but Schlegel, I believe, was
the first to discover the intimate relations between these two
and the Sanscrit, and he applied to the whole three, and their
collateral branches, the name of <em>Indo-Germanic</em> languages.
The discovery attracted the attention both of philologists and
ethnographers, and it is now indubitably proved that the civilizers
of India, and the subverters of the Roman Empire are
descended from the same ethnical stock. It is known that the
Sanscrit is as unlike all other Indian languages, as the high-caste
Brahmins are unlike the Pariahs and all the other aboriginal
races of that country; and Latham has lately come to the
conclusion that it has actually been <em>carried to India from Europe</em>.
It will be seen from this that Mr. Gobineau, in his view of the
origin of various civilizations, is supported in at least several of
the most important instances.
</p><p>
It is a familiar saying that <em>civilization travels westward</em>: if
we believe ethnologists, the Arian races have <em>always migrated
in that direction</em>&mdash;from Central Asia to India, to Asia Minor, to
Egypt, to Greece, to Western Europe, to the western coasts of
the Atlantic, and the same impulse of migration is now carrying
them to the Pacific.&mdash;H.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
